This chapter presents a summary of the ICP 2011 results. Those results are based exclusively on price and national accounts data provided by all the economies participating in the world comparison of ICP 2011. PPPs and real expenditures are compiled in accordance with established ICP principles and the procedures recommended by the Technical Advisory Group for ICP 2011. Users of ICP results are reminded to recognize that the ICP is a complex major statistical exercise whose methodology is constantly being refined and improved.<br><br>
The National Bureau of Statistics (NBS) of China has expressed reservations about some aspects of the methodology employed in the 2011 ICP round and did not agree to publish the headline results for China. Those results were estimated by the 2011 ICP Regional Office in the Asian Development Bank and the 2011 ICP Global Office in the World Bank. However, the NBS of China does not endorse these results as official statistics.<br><br>
The seven main tables of results that appear at the end of this chapter each cover a different aggregate:
<br><br>
<a href= "pic11.html">TABLE 6.1 ICP 2011 Results: GDP</a><br><br>
<a href= "pic12.html">TABLE 6.2 ICP 2011 Results: Actual Individual Consumption</a><br><br>

<a href= "pic14.html">TABLE 6.4 ICP 2011 Results: Individual Consumption Expenditure by Government</a><br><br>
<a href= "pic15.html">TABLE 6.5 ICP 2011 Results: Collective Consumption Expenditure by Government</a><br><br>

Table 6.6, gross fixed capital formation<br><br>

Table 6.7, domestic absorption.
<br><br>
Two supplementary tables are provided as well. Supplementary table 6.8 shows the results for the individual
consumption expenditure by households for the Pacific islands. Supplementary table 6.9 shows the
estimated PPPs for GDP for non-benchmark economies.<br><br>
In the main tables, the results are shown by economy and by region and include regional totals and
averages as well as world totals and averages. The world is defined as all economies1 and regions covered by
the tables. Afghanistan, Argentina, Lebanon, Libya, South Sudan, and the Syrian Arab Republic are the only
large economies that did not take part in ICP 2011 and so are not included in the world totals. They are
included in supplementary table 6.9, which gives imputed real GDP per capita for economies that did not
participate in ICP 2011.<br><br>
Eight regions participated in ICP 2011: Africa, Asia and the Pacific, CIS, Eurostat-OECD, Latin America,
the Caribbean, Western Asia, and the Pacific Islands. All are geographical regions except the Eurostat-
OECD group of economies, which, though predominantly European, includes a worldwide spread of
non-European economies as well. The regional classification of economies used to present the results therefore
differs from the regional classifications used by other international statistical programs. Of the eight regions,
only the first seven are covered in the tables. The comparison for the eighth region―the Pacific Islands―was
limited to household consumption, and, because it did not cover the whole of GDP, its results are shown
separately, in supplementary table 6.8.<br><br>
Two economies, Georgia and the Islamic Republic of Iran, did not participate in a regional comparison.
Instead, they were linked to the global comparison through a bilateral comparison with an economy
participating in a regional comparison: Armenia and the CIS comparison in the case of Georgia, Turkey and
the Eurostat-OECD comparison in the case of the Islamic Republic of Iran. The linking took place after the
global comparison had been calculated, and so their inclusion does not influence either the global or regional
relativities between economies. The two economies are listed at the end of each table as singletons and are
included in the world totals and averages.<br><br>
Four economies―Egypt, Sudan, Russia, and Fiji―participated in two regional comparisons. However,
only the dual participation of Egypt, Sudan, and Russia is of concern here because the dual participation of
Fiji involved the Pacific Islands comparison covered in supplementary table 6.8. Egypt and Sudan participated
in the Africa comparison and the Western Asia comparison; Russia participated in the CIS comparison and
the Eurostat-OECD comparison. In the tables, they appear under both regions and are included in the totals
and averages of both regions. They are included only once in the world totals and averages.<br><br>
The tables provide the same set of measures for the aggregate they cover:<br><br>
- Column (00): Name of economy or region<br><br>
- Column (01): Expenditure based on PPPs in U.S. dollars<br><br>
- Column (02): Expenditure based on exchange rates in U.S. dollars<br><br>
- Column (03): Expenditure per capita based on PPPs in U.S. dollars<br><br>
- Column (04): Expenditure per capita based on exchange rates in U.S. dollars<br><br>
- Column (05): Price level index with the world equal to 100<br><br>

-
Column (06): Expenditure per capita index based on PPP with the world equal to 100<br><br>
-
Column (07): Expenditure per capita index based on exchange rate with the world equal to 100<br><br>
-
Column (08): Expenditure per capita index based on PPP with the United States equal to 100<br><br>
-
Column (09): Expenditure per capita index based on exchange rate with the United States equal to 100<br><br>
-
Column (10): Share of PPP-based world expenditure<br><br>
-
Column (11): Share of exchange rateCbased world expenditure<br><br>
-
Column (12): Share of world population<br><br>
-
Column (13): PPP with the U.S. dollar equal to 1.000<br><br>
-
Column (14): Exchange rate with the U.S. dollar equal to 1.000<br><br>
-
Column (15): Population<br><br>
-
Column (16): Expenditure in national currency unit.<br><br>

The exchange rates in column (14) and the population shares in column (12) and totals in column (15) are the same for all aggregates. They are included in all seven tables for ease of reference.<br><br>
Column (01) shows expenditures on the aggregate covered in the table in U.S. dollars. These expenditures are real expenditures. They reflect only volume differences between economies and regions (see box 3.1). They were obtained by dividing the expenditures on the aggregate in column (16) by the PPPs for the aggregate in column (13). The expenditures per capita in column (03), the expenditure per capita indexes in columns (06) and (08), and the shares in world expenditure on the aggregate in column (10) are all based on the real expenditures in column (01).<br><br>
Column (02) also contains expenditures on the aggregate covered in the table in U.S. dollars, but they are nominal expenditures reflecting both price differences and volume differences between economies and regions (see box 3.1). They were obtained by dividing the expenditures on the aggregate in column (16) by the exchange rates in column (14). The expenditures per capita in column (04), the expenditure per capita indexes in columns (07) and (09), and the shares in world expenditure in column (11) are all based on the nominal expenditures in column (02).<br><br>
Column (13) lists the PPPs for the aggregate covered by the table. They were calculated by the Global Office using price and expenditure data supplied by the regions and the GEKS method. Their principal features are the following:<br><br>
-
They are commensurate, meaning that they do not change when the units of quantity to which their prices refer are changed―for example, when the price of petrol is quoted per gallon rather than per liter.<br><br>
-
They are transitive, meaning that every indirect multilateral PPP between a pair of economies calculated via a third economy equals the direct multilateral PPP between the economies.<br><br>
- They are base economyCinvariant, meaning that the relativities between economies are the same
whichever economy or region is taken as the base.<br><br>
- They provide real expenditures that are free of the Gerschenkron effect, meaning that differences in
volumes of goods and services between very high-income economies and very low-income economies
are measured correctly.<br><br>
- Their real expenditures are not additive, meaning that the real expenditures at higher levels of aggregation
are not equal to the sum of the real expenditures of their components.<br><br>
Moreover, the PPPs respect fixity, meaning that the relativities established between economies in a
regional comparison remain the same when the economies are included in the global comparison.<br><br>
For the ICP 2011 PPPs, the United States serves as the base and the U.S. dollar as the numéraire. But,
being base economyCinvariant, the PPPs can be based on another economy or on another region by dividing
them by the PPP for the economy or region selected as the base. For example, they can be based on the United
Kingdom with the pound sterling as numéraire by dividing them by the PPP for the United Kingdom.<br><br>
Column (05) shows the PLIs for the aggregate covered in the table relative to the world average. A value
above 100 indicates that the price level in the economy is higher than the world average; a value below 100
indicates that the economy’s price level is lower than the world average. The PLIs are base economyCinvariant
and so can be based on another economy or another region. For example, the PLIs in the tables were first
calculated with the United States as base by dividing the PPPs in column (13) by the exchange rates in column
(14). They were subsequently rebased on the world.<br><br>

	<b><a name="T7">Analysis of ICP 2011 Summary Results</a> </b><br>
	<hr><br>
	
The tables described and presented in the previous chapter provide PPP-based estimates of real expenditures and relative price levels for the GDP and six major aggregates related to final consumption, investment, and domestic absorption. This chapter uses these estimates to present analyses of the size of economies, measures of material well-being, and price level indexes for the 177 economies shown in the tables. Of the 199 economies that participated in ICP 2011, full set of results were possible for only 177.1 Thus 22 economies do not have a full set of results. The Pacific Islands comparison, for example, covered only household consumption. The partial results for these economies are given in supplementary table 6.8.<br><br>
The analyses make only limited reference to ICP 2005. The addition of 53 economies (ICP 2011 covered 199 economies compared with 146 in ICP 2005), the shifting of economies from one region to another, and improvements in the methodology limit the comparisons that can be made between the two benchmarks. Moreover, the world has changed since 2005, with some economies enjoying remarkable GDP growth rates even though they were buffeted by the global financial crisis at the midpoint of the 2005C11 period.<br><br>

	<b><a name="T8">Size of Economies</a> </b><br>
	<hr><br>
	
In 2011 the PPP-based world GDP as represented by the 177 economies was $90,647 billion compared with $70,294 billion measured by exchange rates (XRs). Figure 7.1 shows that this 29 percent increase came from the middle-income2 economies, whose share of world GDP went from 32 percent using exchange rates

to 48 percent using PPPs. PPP world shares in low-income economies were more than two times larger than
exchange rate shares in 2011, and yet accounted for only 1.5 percent of the global economy with nearly 11
percent of the world population. High-income economies account for about a half of the world economy. The
figure also shows, for reference, the share of GDP by income group as it stood in 2005.<br><br>


Although high-income economies account for 50 percent of the world’s GDP, they are home to only
about 17 percent of the world’s population. The bulk of the world’s population (72 percent) is in middle-income
economies. As table 7.1 shows, many of the middle-income economies had real GDPs that put them in
the ranks of the world’s largest economies.<br><br>
Six of the 12 largest economies (identified in the table by boldface italics) were in the middle-income
category, but together with other economies they accounted for two-thirds of the world’s economy and 59
percent of the world’s population. Except for Brazil, the shares of the world GDP of the middle-income economies
increased when using PPPs instead of exchange rates to measure GDP. The United States remained the
world’s largest economy, but it was closely followed by China when measured using PPPs. India was now the
world’s third largest economy, moving ahead of Japan.<br><br>
The largest economies were not the richest, as shown in the ranking of GDP per capita. The middle-income
economies with large economies also had large populations, setting the stage for continued growth.

	<hr><br>
It is difficult to compare results between ICP 2005 and ICP 2011 because the number of economies
included was very different, as already mentioned. Table 7.2 shows the relative size of each economy compared
with the United States. India went from the 10th largest economy in 2005 to the third largest in
2011. The economies of Japan and the United Kingdom became smaller relative to the United States, while
Germany increased slightly and France and Italy remained the same. The relative rankings of the three Asian
economies―China, India, and Indonesia―to the United States doubled, while Brazil, Mexico, and Russia
increased by one-third or more. As discussed elsewhere in this report, some of the large differences in the
Asian economies and developing economies in general can be attributed to the changes in the methodology
used for the two comparisons.<br><br>

	<hr><br>
	
Figure 7.2 shows the distribution of the global GDP by ICP regions, comparing PPP-based shares with
exchange rateCbased shares. The PPP-based distribution shows the Asia and the Pacific region accounting in
2011 for over 30 percent of global GDP. The Eurostat-OECD region becomes significantly smaller when PPPbased
GDPs are used. The following sections will shed more light on these distributions. Note that economies
such as Chile and Mexico are not included in the Latin America and Caribbean regions, but in Eurostat-OECD.
Similarly, Japan and the Republic of Korea are included in the Eurostat-OECD region.<br><br>

	<b><a name="T12">Material Well-being</a> </b><br>
	<hr><br>
	
An economy’s GDP divided by its population provides a measure of its relative material well-being compared
with that of other economies. The GDP per capita comparison between economies is best carried out using
PPPs. Table 7.3 shows the PPP-based world shares and per capita expenditures for GDP and major income
economies. Between income categories, huge differences in the per capita levels are evident.<br><br>

The PPP-based per capita expenditures average $40,282 over the 56 high-income economies.<br><br>
However, the 24 economies with per capita GDP expenditures above this average account for over 40
percent of world GDP. Further analysis shows that the distribution of per capita expenditures is highly
skewed. Twenty-eight percent of the world’s population lives in economies with per capita GDP expenditures
above the $13,460 world average and 72 percent live in economies that are below that average.<br><br>
The approximate median per capita expenditure of $10,057 means that half of the world’s population is
experiencing per capita expenditures above that amount and half are experiencing those below. Although
comparisons with 2005 should be carried out with caution, 25 percent of the population in 2005 lived
in economies above the world average compared with 28 percent in 2011. These differences are within
the range of statistical variability.<br><br>
The world shares and per capita expenditures for the major aggregates are consistent with the measures
for GDP. One exception is gross fixed capital formation for the middle-income economies where the world
share for gross fixed capital formation at 55 percent greatly exceeds that for other aggregates. Figure 7.6 later
in this chapter indicates this was the result of the investment levels in the Asia region.<br><br>
Figure 7.3 shows the distribution of the global GDP; economies are arranged in order of GDP per capita
along the horizontal axis and presented as rectangles. The horizontal scale corresponds to each economy’s
share of the world population. GDP per capita is shown on the vertical axis. Each economy’s size in terms of
GDP is thus represented by the area of the rectangle for each economy, which is the product of GDP per capita
and population. The United States, with the 12th largest GDP per capita, is placed at the right. The remaining
11 economies with highest per capita GDP are not visible in this figure because together they account for less
than 0.6 percent of the world population. The intersection of the average line with the rectangles shows the
disparity in per capita GDP across the world.<br><br>

	<b><a name="T13">Price Level Indexes</a> </b><br>
	<hr><br>
The price level index, the ratio of a PPP to a corresponding exchange rate, is used to compare price levels
between economies. PLIs are generally lower in economies with lower per capita measures. Figure 7.4 presents
a multidimensional comparison of per capita GDP scaled to the relative size of each economy; its price level
index with the world is equal to 100. A first observation is that after a certain level of per capita expenditure
is reached, there is a rapid rise in prices rather than continued increases in per capita expenditures. This is
consistent with the fact that as an economy develops consumers move from consuming basic goods that are
also tradable to consuming more services that are not tradable. As wage rates increase, so do the costs of services.
The chart can also be used to review the relative differences between real expenditures based on PPPs
and nominal expenditures based on exchange rates. A PLI of 50 indicates that real expenditures are double
the nominal expenditures. Similarly, the real GDP vis-à-vis nominal GDP for economies with a PLI greater
than 100 is reduced by the size of the PLI.
<br><br>
<a href= "pic19.html">FIGURE 7.4 PLI versus GDP Per Capita (and Size of GDP), 2011 ICP</a><br><br>


Table 7.4 shows the PLIs for the 10 most expensive and 10 least expensive economies in the world. The
PLI for the world equal to 100 is the PLI for the United States equal to 100 times the ratio of nominal expenditures
in U.S. dollars to real expenditures in U.S. dollars. With the exception of Bermuda, the most expensive
economies are in the Eurostat-OECD region. The economies with the lowest prices are either in Africa or Asia
and the Pacific and include India, which has the third-largest economy. Economies with the lowest prices still
have GDP per capita among the smallest in the world even though the PPP-based real expenditures are more
than double the exchange rateCbased nominal expenditures.<br><br>

Price level indexes can be computed for each aggregation level of GDP and by region. Figure 7.5 is a
view of the regional price levels of three major aggregates of GDP. Figure 7.6 shows the regional average real
expenditures per capita on the three aggregates.<br><br>
Actual individual consumption includes all household consumption expenditure as well as general
government and NPISH expenditures on individual goods and services such as health care and education.<br><br>
Collective consumption expenditures by general government include expenditures on services such as
defense, justice, general administration, and protection of the environment. Gross fixed capital formation
measures investment expenditures, which mostly are on purchases of machinery and equipment and construction
services.<br><br>
All three aggregates in the Eurostat-OECD region show price levels above the world average. Only gross
fixed capital formation in the CIS region and collective government in Latin America are at price levels above
the world average. The high price levels of gross fixed capital formation in the CIS region translate to the real
expenditures per capita in figure 7.6 that are below those of all other regions except Africa.<br><br>

Actual individual consumption (AIC) per capita provides a general measure of material well-being of
each economy’s population. AIC makes up the greatest share of GDP in the Eurostat-OECD region, but it is
exceeded by collective government expenditures in every other region except Asia and the Pacific, where the
two measures are about the same.<br><br>
Table 7.5 shows the per capita actual individual consumption first for the 10 economies with the largest
values and then for the 10 economies with the smallest values. Except for the United States and Germany, the
economies with large per capita values are small. The other end of the distribution shows the 10 economies
with per capita values below $1,000. The final two columns of table 7.5 show the ratio of AIC per capita
relative to the United States in 2011 and 2005. The shares of the economies with the smallest values were in
most cases greater than they were in 2005.<br><br>

	<b><a name="T14">Summary</a> </b><br>
	<hr><br>
	
This report has described the interaction between the real sizes of GDP for 177 economies with the relative
price levels for major aggregates and per capita expenditures based on their population sizes. The results indicate
that only a small number of economies have the greatest shares of world GDP. However, the shares of
large economies such as China and India have more than doubled relative to that of the United States. The
spread of per capita actual individual consumption as a percentage of that of the United States has been greatly
reduced, suggesting that the world has become more equal. However, this reduction in the spread must be
interpreted with caution because changes in the ICP methodology and country coverage make it difficult to
make direct comparisons with previous benchmark results.<br><br>
