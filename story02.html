	<hr><br>

The 2011 results of the International Comparison Program<br><br>
EU, US and China together account for half of world GDP<br><br>
In 2011, the Gross Domestic Product (GDP) of the EU28 represented 18.6% of the world's GDP, expressed in Purchasing Power Standards (PPS)1. The United States was the second biggest economy with a share of 17.1% and China the third biggest with 14.9%. Other countries (outside EU28) with a share larger than 1% are shown below.<br><br>

<a href= "pic09.html">Shares in world GDP in PPS, 2011 (%)</a><br><br>


These data were published today by the Global Office of the International Comparison Program (ICP), hosted by the World Bank2, and are the result of the 2011 round of the ICP. The ICP is a worldwide statistical partnership to collect comparative price data and compile detailed expenditure values of countries’ GDP, and to estimate purchasing power parities (PPPs) for the world’s economies. Using PPPs instead of market exchange rates to convert currencies makes it possible to compare the output of economies and the material welfare of their inhabitants in real terms (that is, controlling for differences in price levels). A summary of the results can be found in the table below and in a Statistics Explained article3 on the Eurostat website.<br><br>
Eurostat, the statistical office of the European Union is a partner in the ICP and provided the required data for the 28 EU Member States, three EFTA countries, four candidate countries and two potential candidate countries4.
Eurostat works closely together with OECD in a joint PPP program. OECD provided the data for the non-European OECD countries.<br><br>

<a href= "pic10.html">GDP per capita, 2011</a><br><br>

The Purchasing Power Standard (PPS) is an artificial currency unit that eliminates price level differences between countries.<br><br>
Thus one PPS buys the same volume of goods and services in all countries. This unit allows meaningful volume
comparisons of economic indicators across countries. Aggregates expressed in PPS are derived by dividing aggregates in
current prices and national currency by the respective Purchasing Power Parity (PPP). The level of uncertainty associated
with the basic price and national accounts data, and the methods used for compiling PPPs imply that differences between
countries that have indices within a close range should not be over-interpreted.<br><br>

This summary report describes the key results of the 2011 International Comparison Program (ICP). A comprehensive report presenting the full results will be published in July 2014.<br><br>
The ICP is a worldwide statistical initiative―the largest in geographical scope, in implementation time frame, and in institutional partnership. It estimates purchasing power parities (PPPs) for use as currency converters to compare the size and price levels of economies around the world. The previous round of the program, for reference year 2005, covered 146 economies. The 2011 ICP round covered 199 economies from eight regions, seven of them geographical: Africa, Asia and the Pacific, Commonwealth of Independent States, Latin America, the Caribbean, Western Asia, and the Pacific Islands. The eighth region comprised the economies participating in the regular PPP program managed by the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) and the Statistical Office of the European Communities (Eurostat).<br><br>
On behalf of the ICP Executive Board and the World Bank, we would like to thank all those who contributed to the success of the 2011 ICP program: the national implementing agencies that collected the necessary data in each economy; the regional coordination agencies that supported country activities, compiled the results, and produced regional estimates (i.e., the African Development Bank, Asian Development Bank, Statistical Office of the Commonwealth of Independent States, United Nations Economic Commission for Latin America and the Caribbean, United Nations Economic and Social Commission for Western Asia, Australian Bureau of Statistics, OECD, and Eurostat); and the ICP Global Office, which coordinated and managed the work at the global level. The office is hosted by the Development Data Group at the World Bank Group.<br><br>
Although the responsibility for oversight rested with the Executive Board established under the overall auspices of the United Nations Statistical Commission, the program would not have been such a success without the invaluable theoretical, conceptual, and methodological advice of the ICP Technical Advisory Group of renowned experts.<br><br>
Thanks to the relentless efforts of all those participating in this federated governance structure, the work was carried out according to a calendar that, by and large, has remained unchanged since the inception of the program in the fourth quarter of 2009―an achievement in itself in view of the complexity of such an undertaking. All this testifies to the effectiveness of the system that was rolled out to manage the program and implement related statistical operations. Indeed, a country cannot by itself produce a PPP with other countries. Likewise, a region cannot by itself generate interregional PPPs with other regions. Therefore, there is no other statistical program that requires as much cooperation and trust across countries and between regions as the ICP.<br><br>

Methodological improvements covering four major areas were introduced in the 2011
round of the ICP, leveraging the very strong base provided by ICP 2005. First, the survey frameworks
were further aligned with the ICP conceptual framework to ensure that related data collection
would yield the most reliable average prices possible, and instruments for price surveys were
enhanced accordingly. Second, an ICP national accounts framework was developed to ensure that
expenditure values were compiled in compliance with the System of National Accounts, while also
ensuring consistency with the prices collected and generating the relevant metadata documentation.<br><br>
Third, the Ring approach used in 2005 to link the regions and the Eurostat-OECD PPPs to
the global results was changed to a global core list approach in which all participating countries
were asked to include a common set of items in the regional list of products they surveyed. Fourth,
more broadly, a research agenda was established and then implemented by the Technical Advisory
Group and other experts to advise the Global Office on price survey, expenditure compilation,
data validation, and computation processes to be applied at the country, regional, and global levels.<br><br>
In other developments, all major knowledge items related to the most recent ICP rounds
have been consolidated in a book on PPP theory, methodologies, and computation processes
that was prepared and published in 2013.1 They are also available on the ICP website, which was
revamped to better serve as a repository of ICP knowledge resources and data.2 Meanwhile, a
comprehensive ICP quality assurance framework was developed to ensure that major ICP principles
were being met at the country, regional, and global levels. The aim of the framework was to
introduce rigor, structure, and common criteria for assessment of the quality of the input data and
the results produced. As part of the quality and transparency objective, at the global level parallel
and independent processes were established for the validation of input data, computation of PPPs,
and review of the final results. Finally, the limitations of the data and methods were identified,
and they are explicitly described in this report and will be covered in more detail in the full report.<br><br>
Because of the many important changes in economic and price structures since 2005 and a number
of methodological improvements, users of the data are urged to be cautious when comparing
the ICP 2011 results with those for ICP 2005.<br><br>
We believe that the ICP 2011 results represent the most comprehensive price data and GDP
expenditure values, using the best methods that have ever been developed. We are also very pleased
to see that ICP-related activities have played a fruitful role in the regions, serving as capacity-building
platforms in the areas of prices and national accounts statistics.<br><br>
We trust that users of the ICP 2011 results will find this summary report useful and that
those results will form a crucial information base for research in comparative analysis and policy
making. We hope that in the future more regular data collection and compilation will support
a more frequent PPP exercise at the global level.<br><br>
Once again, we wish to express our sincere thanks to all those involved in this very
gratifying undertaking.<br><br>

On the recommendation of the United Nations Statistical Commission (UNSC), the International Comparison Program (ICP) was established in the late 1960s. It began as a research project carried out jointly by the United Nations Statistical Office and the University of Pennsylvania. The first comparison, conducted in 1970, covered 10 economies. Now, 40 years later, the ICP is a worldwide statistical operation whose latest comparison― ICP 2011―involved 199 economies. The program is led and coordinated by the ICP Global Office hosted by the World Bank.<br><br>
The purpose of the ICP is to compare the gross domestic product (GDP) of economies to determine those economies’ relative size, productivity, and material well-being. Because economies estimate their GDP at national price levels and in national currencies, those GDPs are not comparable. To be compared, they must be valued at a common price level and expressed in a common currency. The ICP uses purchasing power parities (PPPs) to effect this double conversion. PPPs are price indexes that serve as spatial price deflators. They make it possible to compare the GDPs of economies in real terms by removing the price level differences between them. This situation closely parallels GDP comparisons over time for a single economy where it is necessary to remove the price changes between the periods being compared in order to assess the changes in the underlying real expenditures.<br><br>
To calculate PPPs for its comparisons, the ICP holds worldwide surveys at regular intervals―currently, every six years―to collect comparable price and expenditure data for the whole range of final goods and services that make up the final expenditure on GDP: consumer goods and services, government services, and capital goods. The surveys are organized by region and are coordinated by an agency located in the region. The intention is to produce regional comparisons that can be combined in a single global comparison for a given reference year. The main reasons for conducting the surveys on a regional basis are that the products to be priced tend to be more homogeneous within regions, the expenditure patterns are likely to be similar, and the language differences are reduced. In addition, there are operational advantages in having the ICP surveys carried out by agencies that are in relatively close proximity to the economies they are coordinating.<br><br>

ICP 2011 covered eight regions. Seven of the eight were ICP regions that were overseen by the Global Office and regional agencies. These regions were the following geographical entities: Africa, Asia and the Pacific, Commonwealth of Independent States (CIS), Latin America, the Caribbean, Western Asia, and the Pacific Islands. The eighth region was neither an ICP region nor a geographical region. It comprised the economies that were participating in the PPP program run by Eurostat, the statistics office of the European Union, and the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD). The economies were predominantly European ones, as well as economies from regions outside Europe. Even so, the economies were treated as though they were an autonomous region for the purposes of incorporating them in the global comparison. The agenda and timetable of the Eurostat-OECD program differ from that of the ICP, but it employs a similar methodology. Eurostat and the OECD worked closely with the Global Office to ensure that their economies could be included with the economies of the seven ICP regions in the 2011 global comparison.<br><br>
The regional agencies responsible for the comparisons in the seven ICP regions were the African Development Bank, Asian Development Bank, Statistical Office of the CIS, United Nations Economic Commission for Latin America and the Caribbean, United Nations Economic and Social Commission for Western Asia, and Australian Bureau of Statistics. These agencies shared that responsibility with the national agencies coordinating the comparison. The national agencies carried out data collection and data validation within their respective economies. The regional agencies provided the national agencies with methodological and operational guidance. They coordinated and supervised data collection and data validation within the region in line with the global timetable. They also put together and finalized the regional comparisons and published the results. The Global Office assumed responsibility for ensuring that the seven regional comparisons and the Eurostat-OECD comparison could be combined in the global comparison and then combining them. The compilation, validation, and publication of the global results were also responsibilities of the Global Office.<br><br>
The global results include two singleton economies―Georgia and the Islamic Republic of Iran― that did not participate in any of the regional comparisons. They were linked to the global comparison through a bilateral comparison with an economy participating in a regional comparison. The bilateral comparison provided a bridge to the regional comparison, and the regional comparison provided a bridge to the other regions of the global comparison. Georgia was linked to the CIS comparison through a bilateral comparison with
Armenia, and the Islamic Republic of Iran was linked to the Eurostat-OECD comparison through a bilateral
comparison with Turkey. The bilateral comparisons were organized and coordinated by the Global Office.<br><br>
The global results also cover four economies that participated in two regional comparisons. The dual
participants were the Arab Republic of Egypt and Sudan, which participated in the Africa and Western Asia
comparisons; the Russian Federation, which participated in the CIS and Eurostat-OECD comparisons; and
Fiji, which participated in the Asia and the Pacific and the Pacific Islands comparisons. In the presentation of
the global results, these dual participants appear under both regions, but they are included only once in the
world totals. Dual participation required additional coordination between the regional agencies responsible
for the regional comparisons affected. They had to ensure that the price, expenditure, population, and other
data common to both comparisons were the same.<br><br>
Throughout all stages of the 2011 comparison, the activities of the Global Office were overseen by the
Executive Board, which reported in turn to the UNSC. The board provided strategic leadership, set priorities
and standards, and guided the Global Office’s overall work program. The objective was to ensure that the
global comparison was completed on time and that it produced price and volume measures of high quality. To
this end, the board appointed a Technical Advisory Group of international experts to assist the Global Office
with the conceptual, methodological, and technical questions that arose during the comparison. In addition,
three task forces were formed: the Validation Expert Group to oversee the validation of data provided for the
global comparison; the Computation Task Force (a group of computation experts) to calculate the global
results independently from each other and ensure their convergence; and the Results Review Group to review
the results in terms of their plausibility and adherence to the agreed-on methodologies and procedures.<br><br>

	<b><a name="T6">Conceptual Framework</a> </b><br>
	<hr><br>
	
ICP comparisons of GDP are based on an identity: value = price × volume. GDP is a measure of production, but GDP can be estimated from the expenditure side and the income side, as well as from the production side, with the three approaches, in theory, yielding the same result. However, whereas values estimated from the production side and the expenditure side can be split into meaningful price and volume components, values estimated from the income side cannot. In other words, price and volume comparisons of GDP can be made from the production side and from the expenditure side, but not from the income side. ICP comparisons are made from the expenditure side. This allows the levels of the principal elements of final demand―consumption and investment―to be compared. It also avoids the difficulties encountered in organizing comparisons from the production side, which requires data for both intermediate consumption and gross output in order to effect double deflation.<br><br>
Economies estimate their expenditures on GDP at national price levels and in national currencies. Before the estimates can be used to compare the volumes of goods and services produced by the economies, differences in national price levels have to be eliminated and national currencies have to be converted to a common currency. Differences in price levels between economies can be removed either by observing the volumes directly or by deriving them indirectly using a measure of relative prices to place the expenditures of all the economies on the same price level. Prices are easier to observe than volumes, and direct measures of relative prices usually have smaller variability than direct measures of relative volumes. In ICP comparisons, volumes are mostly estimated indirectly using direct measures of relative prices―the PPPs―to deflate expenditures. In addition to acting as spatial price deflators, PPPs are also currency converters. Thus PPP-deflated expenditures are expressed in the same currency unit and are also valued at the same price level.<br><br>

	<b><a name="T7">Exchange Rates</a> </b><br>
	<hr><br>
	
Before PPPs became widely available, exchange rates were used for international comparisons of GDP. Exchange rates, however, only convert GDPs to a common currency. They do not provide GDPs valued at a common price level because exchange rates do not reflect the relative purchasing power of currencies in


their national markets. For them to do so, all goods and services would have to be traded internationally, and
the supply and demand for currencies would have to be driven predominantly, if not solely, by the currency
requirements of international trade. But this is not the case. Many goods and services such as buildings,
government services, and most market services are not traded internationally, and the supply and demand
for currencies are influenced primarily by factors such as currency speculation, interest rates, government
intervention, and capital flows between economies. Consequently, as equation (2) in box 3.1 indicates, GDPs
converted to a common currency with exchange rates remain valued at national price levels. Differences
between them reflect both differences in the volumes of goods and services produced by the economies and
differences in the price levels of the economies. On the other hand, as equation (4) in box 3.1 shows, GDPs
converted with PPPs reflect only differences in the volumes produced by economies.<br><br>

Exchange rateCconverted GDPs can be highly misleading in indicating the relative sizes of economies and
levels of material well-being. Price levels are normally higher in high-income economies than they are in
low-income economies, and, as a result, differences in price levels between high-income economies and
low-income economies are greater for nontraded products than they are for traded products. Before the
addition of tariffs, subsidies, and trade costs, the prices of traded products are basically determined globally
by the law of one price, whereas the prices of nontraded products are determined by local circumstances, in
particular by wages and salaries, which are generally higher in high-income economies. If the larger price
level differences for nontraded products are not taken into account when converting GDPs to a common
currency, the size of high-income economies with high price levels will be overstated and the size of low-income
economies with low price levels will be understated. No distinction is made between traded products
and nontraded products when exchange rates are used to convert GDPs to a common currency: the rate is the same for all products. PPP-converted GDPs do not have this bias because, as explained shortly, PPPs are calculated first for individual products. They thus take into account the different price levels for traded products and nontraded products.
ICP PPPs are designed specifically for international comparisons of GDP. They are not designed to compare monetary flows or trade flows. International comparisons of flows, such as development aid, foreign direct investment, migrants’ remittances, or exports and imports of goods and services, should be made with exchange rates, not with PPPs.<br><br>

	<hr><br>
	
PPPs are price relatives that show the ratio of the prices in national currencies of the same good or service in different economies. For example, if the price of a hamburger in France is 4.80 and in the United States it is $4.00, the PPP for hamburgers between the two economies is $0.83 to the euro from the French perspective (4.00/4.80) and 1.20 to the dollar from the U.S. perspective (4.80/4.00). In other words, for every euro spent on hamburgers in France, $0.83 would have to be spent in the United States to obtain the same quantity and quality―that is, the same volume―of hamburgers. Conversely, for every dollar spent on hamburgers in the United States, 1.20 would have to be spent in France to obtain the same volume of hamburgers. To compare the volumes of hamburgers purchased in the two economies, either the expenditure on hamburgers in France can be expressed in dollars by dividing by 1.20 or the expenditure on hamburgers in the United States can be expressed in euros by dividing by 0.83.<br><br>
PPPs are calculated in stages: first for individual goods and services, then for groups of products, and finally for each of the various levels of aggregation up to GDP. PPPs continue to be price relatives whether they refer to a product group, to an aggregation level, or to GDP. In moving up the aggregation hierarchy, the price relatives refer to increasingly complex assortments of goods and services. Thus, if the PPP for GDP between France and the United States is 0.95 to the dollar, it can be inferred that for every dollar spent on GDP in the United States, 0.95 would have to be spent in France to purchase the same volume of goods and services. Purchasing the same volume of goods and services does not mean that the baskets of goods and services purchased in both economies will be identical. The composition of the baskets will vary between economies and reflect differences in tastes, cultures, climates, price structures, product availability, and income levels, but both baskets will, in principle, provide equivalent satisfaction or utility.<br><br>

	<b><a name="T9">Price Level Indexes</a> </b><br>
	<hr><br>
	
PPPs are spatial price indexes. They show with reference to a base economy the price of a given basket of goods and services in each of the economies being compared. This index is similar to a temporal price index, which shows with reference to a base period the price of a given basket of goods and services at different points in time. However, unlike the temporal price index in which the indexes at the different points in time are expressed in the same currency unit so that price changes over time are readily identifiable, the PPP index for each economy is expressed in the economy’s national currency. It is thus not possible to say whether one economy is more expensive or less expensive than another. To do this, one would have to standardize the indexes by expressing them in a common currency unit. The common currency used for the global comparison is the U.S. dollar, and so each economy’s PPP has been standardized by dividing it by that economy’s dollar exchange rate. The standardized indexes so obtained are called price level indexes (PLIs).<br><br>

Economies with PLIs greater than 100 have price levels that are higher than that of the base economy.
Economies with PLIs less than 100 have price levels that are lower than that of the base economy. So,
returning to the hamburger example, if the exchange rate is $1.00 to 0.79, the PLI for a hamburger with
the United States as the base economy is 152 (1.20/0.79 × 100). From this, it can be inferred that, given the
relative purchasing power of the dollar and the euro, hamburgers cost 52 percent more in France than they
do in the United States. In addition to products, PLIs can be calculated for product groups, aggregates, and
GDP. At the level of GDP, PLIs provide a measure of the differences in the general price levels of economies.<br><br>
Thus if the PPP for GDP between France and the United States is $0.95 to the euro, the PLI for GDP based
on the United States is 120 (0.95/0.79 × 100), indicating that the general price level of France is 20 percent
higher than that of the United States.<br><br>
It is worth remembering that PPPs evolve slowly, whereas exchange rates can change quickly. Sudden
changes in PLIs are usually the result of fluctuations in exchange rates. When exchange rates change rapidly,
the PLI for an economy could change rapidly as well, reflecting the fact that an economy that was relatively
cheap has now become relatively expensive compared with the base economy. The volatility of exchange rates
is another reason they should not be used to compare the size of economies. Fluctuation in exchange rates
can make economies appear suddenly larger or smaller even though there has been little or no change in the
relative volume of goods and services produced.<br><br>

	<b><a name="T10">Real Expenditures</a> </b><br>
	<hr><br>
	
Economies report nominal expenditures on GDP and its constituent aggregates and product groups. Nominal
expenditures are expenditures that are valued at national price levels. They can be expressed in national currencies
or, when converted with exchange rates, in a common currency. In the latter, the converted expenditures
remain nominal because, as explained earlier, exchange rates do not correct for differences in price levels
between economies, and so the expenditures are still valued at national price levels. For the ICP, economies
report their nominal expenditures in national currencies.<br><br>
PPPs are used to convert these nominal expenditures to real expenditures. Real expenditures are expenditures
that are valued at a common price level. They reflect real or actual differences in the volumes purchased
in economies and provide the measures required for international volume comparisons: indexes of real expenditure
and indexes of real expenditure per capita. At the level of GDP, indexes of real expenditure are widely
used to compare the size of economies, and indexes of real expenditure per capita are frequently used to compare
the material well-being of their resident populations. Although the indexes of real expenditure and real
expenditure per capita for GDP are the most well known, indexes of real expenditure and real expenditure per
capita for aggregates and product groups are also important, allowing in-depth analysis of comparison results.<br><br>

	<b><a name="T11">Actual Individual Consumption</a> </b><br>
	<hr><br>
	
One aggregate below the level of GDP that has particular significance in ICP comparisons is actual individual
consumption (AIC). On a per capita basis, it is a better measure of material well-being than either GDP or
the household final consumption expenditure, when material well-being is defined in terms of the goods and
services consumed by households to satisfy their individual needs. Such goods and services are referred to
as individual goods and services, and the expenditure on individual goods and services is referred to as the
individual consumption expenditure.<br><br>

GDP covers the individual goods and services consumed by resident households. But it also includes the collective services―such as defense, public order and safety, and environment protection―that the general government provides to meet the collective needs of the community, as well as gross capital formation and net exports, which do not constitute final consumption. By contrast, the household final consumption expenditure covers only the individual goods and services that households purchase. It does not take into account the individual services such as health care, education, and social protection that general government and nonprofit institutions serving households (NPISHs) provide to households individually. The provision of such services, particularly health care and education, can vary considerably from economy to economy. If only household expenditures are compared, economies in which the households themselves purchase health care and education services will appear to consume more than households in economies in which these services are provided by general government or NPISHs.<br><br>
Actual individual consumption comprises all the goods and services that households consume to meet their individual needs. It covers all such goods and services whether they are purchased by households or are provided by general government and NPISHs. AIC is defined as the sum of the individual consumption expenditures of households, general government, and NPISHs. The concept of actual individual consumption dates back to the earliest years of the ICP. It was originally called the consumption expenditure of the population. Initially, the individual consumption expenditure by NPISHs was not included. Later, however, the concept was expanded to include the consumption expenditure of NPISHs, and it was adopted by national accountants in the System of National Accounts, 1993, or SNA 93 (Commission of the European Communities et al. 1993).<br><br>

	<b><a name="T12">Uses of PPPs and Real Expenditures</a> </b><br>
	<hr><br>
	
PPPs and the PLIs and indexes of real expenditure they give rise to are used in research and analysis, in statistical compilation, and for administrative purposes. The principal users are international bodies such as the World Bank, the International Monetary Fund (IMF), the United Nations and its affiliates, OECD, and the European Commission. Improvements in the timeliness, frequency, and coverage of ICP comparisons, however, have stimulated a growing demand for PPP-based measures from a variety of national users―in particular, government agencies, universities, and research institutes.<br><br>
Researchers and policy makers at both the international and national levels use PPPs as inputs into economic research and policy analysis that involve comparisons of economies. In this context, PPPs are employed either to generate measures of real expenditure with which to compare the size of economies and their levels of material well-being, consumption, investment, government expenditure, and overall productivity, or to generate price measures with which to compare price levels, price structures, price convergence, and competitiveness. PPP-converted GDPs are used to standardize other economic variables such as carbon emissions per unit of GDP, energy use per unit of GDP, GDP per employee, or GDP per hour worked. Multinational corporations, for example, use PPPs to evaluate the cost of investment in different economies.
One major use of PPPs is poverty assessment using the World Bank’s international poverty threshold of $1.25 per day per person. National poverty assessments differ because the purchasing power of national currencies differs from one economy to another. Therefore, to establish an international poverty line one must equalize purchasing power needs over economies. This is carried out by converting the international poverty line of $1.25 to national price levels with consumption PPPs. Data from household surveys are then used to determine the number of people whose per capita consumption is below this poverty line. The international poverty line itself has typically been calculated as the average of the national poverty lines of the world’s
poorest economies, first converted to international dollars using the consumption PPPs. The PPPs thus enter
the calculation at two stages―first, in establishing the line and, second, in calculating the number of people
below it in each economy.<br><br>
Eradication of hunger and poverty is the first United Nations Millennium Development Goal. Other
goals are in the areas of health care, particularly that of mothers and children, and primary education. The
World Health Organization uses PPPs when comparing per capita expenditures on health care across economies.
Similarly, the United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization (UNESCO) uses PPPs
when assessing the per capita expenditures on education of different economies. A related use is estimation of
the United Nations Human Development Index; PPP-converted gross national income per capita is one of
the three variables that constitute the index.<br><br>
PPPs are also used for statistical compilation. International organizations use PPPs to calculate totals
and averages for groups of economies such as the ICP regions. Real GDP and its components are aggregated
across the economies in a group to obtain totals for the group. The shares of economies in these totals are used
as weights when economic indicators, such as price indexes or growth rates, are combined to obtain averages
for the groups. Both the IMF and OECD use PPP-based GDP and GDP aggregates to provide estimates of
regional and world output and growth in their respective World Economic Outlook and Economic Outlook.<br><br>
Finally, PPPs are employed for administrative purposes by the European Commission and the IMF.<br><br>
The European Commission uses the PPPs of its member states when allocating the structural funds intended
to reduce economic disparities between and within member states. The principal indicator influencing the
allocation is PPP-deflated intra-economy regional GDP per capita. The IMF uses PPP-based GDP from the
World Economic Outlook in its current quota formula, which has often helped guide increases in members’
quotas in the past. Quota subscriptions determine the maximum amount of financial resources member
economies are obliged to provide the IMF, the amount of financing members can obtain from the IMF, their
share in a general allocation of special drawing rights, and their voting power in IMF decisions. PPP-based
GDP has a weight of 20 percent in the current quota formula.<br><br>

	<b><a name="T13">Overview of Methodology</a> </b><br>
	<hr><br>
	
The ICP has three major components. The first component is the conceptual framework, which is determined by the final expenditures making up GDP. The second component is the basket of goods and services from which products are selected for pricing: the products are comparable across economies and are an important part of each economy’s final purchases. The national annual average prices or quantity data collected for these goods and services must be consistent with the underlying values in the national accounts. The third component is the methodology used to compute PPPs, first within regions for the regional comparisons and then across regions for the global comparison.<br><br>
The PPPs provided by the ICP are based on a large body of statistical and economic theory fully documented in Measuring the Real Size of the World Economy: The Framework, Methodology, and Results of the International Comparison Program (ICP) (World Bank 2013). This volume describes the many methods available for ICP 2005, the choices made, and the lessons learned that were applied to ICP 2011.<br><br>

<a href= "link02.html">裙带资本主义：香港排第一</a><br><br>

<a href= "link03.html">德国人偏爱俄罗斯</a><br><br>
<a href= "link10.html">格林斯潘：中国经济高增长是借来的</a><br><br>

The estimation of PPPs begins by breaking down GDP into 155 basic headings. Basic headings, the lowest level at which expenditure estimates are required, are the product groups into which individual goods or services are placed for pricing purposes. Basic headings fall into three categories. The first consists of the products consumers purchase in various markets. Prices are obtained by means of market surveys. This category is the basis for nearly all basic headings under the aggregate household final consumption expenditure. The second category is dwelling rents, health care, education, government services, construction, and equipment. These goods and services are difficult to compare and require data beyond what can be collected in market surveys. The third category is those basic headings for which price or value data are either not available, such as narcotics, or too difficult or too expensive to obtain.<br><br>
PPPs are first computed at the individual product level within each basic heading for each pair of economies being compared. Suppose three economies―A, B, and C―price three kinds of rice for the basic heading Rice. For each kind of rice, there are three PPPs: PB/PA , PC/PA, and PC/PB . The basic heading PPP for each pair of economies can be computed directly by taking the geometric mean of the PPPs between them for the three kinds of rice. This is a bilateral comparison. The PPP between economies B and A can be computed indirectly: PPPC/A × PPPB/C = PPPB/A. The use of both direct and indirect PPPs is a multilateral<br><br>
comparison. This means that the PPPs between any two economies are affected by their respective PPPs with
each other economy. A change in the mix of economies included in the comparison will also change the PPPs
between any two economies.<br><br>
Different methods can be used to compute multilateral PPPs. The choice of method is based on two
basic properties―transitivity and base country invariance. PPPs are transitive when the PPP between any two
economies is the same whether it is computed directly or indirectly through a third economy. PPPs are base
countryCinvariant if the PPP between any two economies is the same regardless the choice of base country.
These properties apply for every computational step: computing basic heading PPPs between economies,
aggregating basic heading PPPs to the within-region GDP, linking basic heading PPPs across regions, and
then computing global PPPs.<br><br>
Another property underlying the computational steps to obtain PPPs for ICP 2011 (and ICP 2005) is
that economies be treated equally regardless of the size of their GDP. Weights based on basic heading expenditures
are used in the methodology to weight a group of basic headings to an aggregate level. Therefore, PPPs
are first weighted using economy A’s weights (Laspeyres index), and then weighted using economy B’s weights
(Paasche index). Each index provides a weighted average of the PPP between economy A and economy B. To
maintain symmetry, the geometric mean is taken of the two aggregated PPPs for every pair of economies in
the comparison. The result is a Fisher index. For each pair of economies, the multilateral PPP is the geometric
mean of the direct and indirect Fisher indexes.<br><br>
This method, however, does not satisfy the additivity requirement. Additivity occurs when the sum of
the real expenditures of the basic headings constituting an aggregate equals the real expenditures based on the
PPPs for the aggregate. Additive methods have the disadvantage of giving more weight to the relative prices
of the larger, more developed economies. As a result, the real expenditures of poor economies become larger
and move closer to the real expenditures of rich economies. This is known as the Gerschenkron effect. For uses
of ICP PPPs such as poverty analysis, nonadditive methods that avoid the Gerschenkron bias are preferred.
Fixity is yet another concept that determines the methods used. The fixity concept means that the relative
volume―the ratio of real expenditures―between any pair of economies in a region remains the same
after the region has been combined with economies in other regions.<br><br>
The following sections provide an overview of the methodology used to obtain regional and global
PPPs for household consumption, housing rents, government compensation, construction, and equipment.<br><br>

	<b><a name="T14">Household Consumption</a> </b><br>
	<hr><br>
	
Statistical theory suggests that a master frame should list every possible product purchased by consumers
and the annual expenditures associated with each product for every economy. A random sample of products
would be selected for which national annual average prices would be determined. The expenditure on each
product would be used to weight product PPPs to basic heading PPPs. The reality, however, is that there is
no such list. Although statistical theory can be used to determine the number of products to be priced, it is
left to the regional and national coordinators using their expert judgment to select the actual products out
of the thousands of possibilities. Measuring the Real Size of the World Economy (World Bank 2013) provides
guidelines on the number of products to be priced. For example, it recommends that 10C15 products be
priced for the rice basic heading compared with 70C100 for the garment basic heading. Rice is a relatively
homogeneous product, although it is necessary to specify the different varieties to be priced. Garments are
much more heterogeneous.<br><br>

Comparability of the products being priced is an essential principle underlying the estimation of PPPs.
A dilemma facing the ICP is that, although a product may be available in several economies, it may be a significant
part of consumption in only a few. Because there are no data on expenditures for individual products,
the relative prices or product PPPs would have to be averaged with equal weights to obtain the basic heading
PPP. To overcome this problem, the Eurostat-OECD and CIS regions adopted the concept of representativity
to induce a form of weighting. A representative product is one that is purchased frequently by households
and has a price level consistent with the majority of products in the basic heading. Because representative
products are those most frequently purchased, it is likely that they have lower price levels in economies where
they are representative compared with the price levels in economies where the product is available but not
representative. This factor can lead to bias if not taken into account when computing basic heading PPPs.
A simpler method was used in the remaining regions. Economies other than those in the Eurostat-
OECD and CIS regions were asked to classify all goods and services for household consumption as either
important or less important. Importance is defined by reference to the notional expenditure share of a product
within its basic heading. The importance classification is a subjective process, as is the assignment of representativeness,<br><br>
but it is easier to apply. If the expenditure share is thought to be large, the product is classified
as important; if it is thought to be small, it is classified as less important.<br><br>
The steps taken to arrive at PPPs for household consumption within regions took into account the
methods used to calibrate within-region PPPs to global PPPs:<br><br>

-The Global Office developed a list of global core products that would be priced by all economies.
These prices would be used to compute between-region PPPs for each basic heading.<br><br>
-Each region developed its own list of products for its comparison and incorporated as many of the
global core list products as possible.<br><br>
-Each economy within a region classified the products they priced from the regional product list and
the global core product list as important or less important.<br><br>
Chapters 4 and 5 of Measuring the Real Size of the World Economy (World Bank 2013) describe the different
properties of the various indexes that can be used to compute basic heading PPPs and aggregate them
to GDP. The basic methodology used in 2011 was as follows:<br><br>
-Within-region basic heading PPPs were based on regional product prices and global core product
prices. Product PPPs were averaged to the basic heading using the country product dummy-
weighted (CPD-W) method, with weights of 3:1 for important versus less important products.<br><br>
The JevonsCGini-Elteto-Koves-Szulc* (Jevons-GEKS*) method was used in the Eurostat-OECD
and CIS regions to compute basic heading PPPs. The Jevons-GEKS* method used the representative
classification by giving a weight of 1 to the prices of representative products and a weight of 0 to
unrepresentative products.<br><br>
-All regions used the Gini-Elteto-Koves-Szulc (GEKS) to average basic heading PPPs to higher-level
aggregates.<br><br>

At this stage, within-region PPPs are aggregated to the level of household consumption. Chapter 6 in
Measuring the Real Size of the World Economy (World Bank 2013) reviews the properties of the various methods
<br><br>
to link within-region PPPs. The steps used in 2011 to link basic heading PPPs for household consumption
across regions were the following:<br><br>
-Global core product prices provided by all economies were deflated to a regional currency
using within-region basic heading PPPs. The result was five sets of regional prices treated as
“super economies.”<br><br>
-The CPD-W over these five sets of regional prices provided between-region basic heading PPPs
linking each region to a base region.<br><br>
-Multiplying the within-region basic heading PPPs by the between-region basic heading PPPs
converted them to a global currency. Multiplying the same regional scalar by each economy’s
within-region PPP converted it to a global PPP. This method preserved within-region fixity,
which means the relative rankings between economies in the same region remained the same
after linking.<br><br>
The steps just described were applied only to the Africa, Asia and the Pacific, Eurostat-OECD, Latin
America, Caribbean, and Western Asia regions, but not the CIS. The CIS region was linked to the Eurostat-
OECD region through Russia and through the Eurostat-OECD region to the other regions. This method
is described later in this chapter in the section “Special Situations.”<br><br>
The concepts and methodology just described were essentially the same for the remaining aggregates
described in the rest of this chapter.<br><br>

	<b><a name="T15">Housing (Dwelling Rents)</a> </b><br>
	<hr><br>
	
All economies participating in the ICP were asked to collect average annual rents for a global list of dwelling
types and dwelling stock data (i.e., number of dwellings, usable surface area in square meters, and information
on three quality indicators). In addition, the national accounts questionnaire collected details on the
expenditure on actual and imputed rents.<br><br>
Not all economies were able to report rents and dwelling stock data, and some were only able
to provide rents for a subset of dwelling types or limited dwelling stock data. Each regional coordinator
decided subsequently on the best way to use the collected data for his or her region:<br><br>
-The Africa, Latin America, Caribbean, and Western Asia regions calculated their regional PPPs
on the basis of the rents collected for the global list of dwelling types, following the same CPD
method used for the rest of household consumption but without importance indicators.<br><br>
-Asia and the Pacific, after in-depth analysis of the available data, resorted to using a reference
volume approach. This implies that the relative volumes of housing services between economies
are equal to the relative volumes of household expenditure, excluding rents.<br><br>
-Eurostat-OECD used a mix of rents and dwelling stock data. Generally, for economies that have
a well-developed rental market PPPs are determined on the basis of the rental data, whereas for
other economies dwelling stock data are used to obtain estimates of PPPs indirectly. Indirect PPPs are based on the relationship price × quantity = expenditure. An indirect PPP can be derived
by dividing the expenditure on rents from an economy’s national accounts by the real expenditures
on rents estimated using dwelling stock data adjusted for quality. This is referred to as the quantity
method of estimating real expenditures and the indirect method of estimating PPPs.<br><br>
-The quantity method was used in the CIS region, which was then linked to other regions using
Russia as the bridge country.<br><br>
The rental data used to link the Africa, Latin America, Caribbean, and Western Asia regions were the
same as those that entered the calculation of their regional PPPs. Linking factors for these three regions were
calculated by means of the same CPD method used to link the rest of household expenditures. For Asia and
the Pacific and Eurostat-OECD, the method chosen was to link them to each other and to the rest of the
world through use of the dwelling stock data.<br><br>
The dwelling stock data provided by the economies were carefully analyzed. The preferred measure of
housing quantity―usable surface area in square meters―could not be used because too few economies had
reliable data. Thus the basic quantity information used was number of dwellings, for which a sufficient number
of economies within each region provided an estimate. It was not possible to make further distinctions
within total dwellings, which would have enriched the estimations.<br><br>
The plausibility of each economy’s estimate of number of dwellings was evaluated by calculating the
ratio of the number of dwellings to the total population. Economies with very high or very low ratios were
not included in the linking process. For each economy with a plausible estimate of number of dwellings,
the data on housing quality were reviewed. Three quality indicators were available: share of dwellings with
electricity, share of dwellings with inside water, and share of dwellings with a private toilet. Only economies
for which a plausible estimate for all three indicators was available or could be imputed were included in the
linking process.<br><br>

	<b><a name="T16">Government Compensation</a> </b><br>
	<hr><br>
	
The main components of the government final consumption expenditure are health care, education, and
collective services such as general administration, defense, police, fire fighting, and environmental protection.
The health care and education services provided by government are classified as individual services because
they are offered to individuals rather than collectively to an economy’s residents. The individual services
provided by government are combined with similar services purchased by residents (and NPISHs) as part of
the household final consumption expenditure to form actual final consumption. Actual final consumption
covers all expenditures on individual services. It is an important aggregate because it enables comparisons to
be made between economies that have markedly different institutional arrangements for providing services
such as health care and education. For example, in some economies these types of services are supplied (sold)
largely by the private sector, while in others government agencies provide virtually all of these services. Most
economies fall somewhere between these two extremes, and estimating real expenditures for actual final consumption
provides a means of comparing economies that is not affected by the extent to which these services
are provided (or financed) by either the government or the private sector.<br><br>
Government-produced services are considered to be nonmarket services because they are provided free
or sold at prices that are not economically significant and therefore have no observable value of output. SNA
93 recommends that nonmarket services be measured using the input cost approach. In other words, the


value of their output is recorded as the sum of the costs of production―that is, the sum of compensation of
employees, intermediate consumption, and consumption of fixed capital. Basic headings were specified for
each of these inputs in the ICP expenditure classification, but prices were collected only for the compensation
of a range of employees engaged in producing government health care, education, and collective services. The
compensation collected covered a number of carefully selected and well-defined occupations that are typical
of government expenditures around the world.1<br><br>
Measuring the compensation of government employees is a difficult area for the ICP because labor productivity
in government varies markedly between economies. Detailed specifications were provided for each
occupation, including required level of education and experience. Factors such as workers’ levels of education
and the availability of equipment such as computers are key elements of such differences in productivity. It
was essential to adjust for productivity differences between economies, because not adjusting for them in some
regions would have significantly distorted the estimates of real expenditures for government. In some cases,
the distortions would have been so large that they would have affected comparisons of real expenditures on
GDP. For example, in the Asia and the Pacific region average compensation (based on exchange rates) in the
government sector of Hong Kong SAR, China was about 100 times higher than in the poorest economies in
the region. If no productivity adjustments were made, economies in which government salaries were very low
would have had very high real consumption of government services compared with the high-income economies
in the region in which government salaries were relatively much higher.<br><br>
Adjustments for productivity differences were made to the real expenditure estimates for government
in the Africa, Asia and the Pacific, Latin America, and Caribbean regions. No productivity adjustments
were applied within the Eurostat-OECD, CIS, and Western Asia regions because differences in labor
productivity within each of those regions were considered to be relatively small. However, productivity
adjustments were made to all regions when the interregional linking factors were estimated to maintain
consistency in the global comparison.<br><br>
Productivity adjustments were calculated using capital-labor estimates for each economy. It was not
possible to estimate productivity adjustments directly for the government sector, and so they were based on
comparisons of economy-wide capital-labor estimates. Productivity estimates were imputed for economies
that had insufficient data to calculate such estimates. They were based on the productivity estimates for similar
types of economies in their region.<br><br>

Machinery and Equipment<br><br>

The procedures followed for collecting prices for machinery and equipment were similar to those followed
for household consumption. Detailed product specifications were prepared for a global list that was generally
used by all ICP regions for their regional comparisons and again by the Global Office to link the regions. For
consistency with SNA 93, pricing rules were defined for transport and installation costs, nondeductible taxes,
and discounts. Basic heading PPPs were computed with the CPD method―the importance classification
was not applied.<br><br>

	<b><a name="T17">Construction</a> </b><br>
	<hr><br>
	
Construction is one of the comparison-resistant components of the ICP because it is not possible to
compare actual construction projects from one economy to another. Historically, the ICP used an output
method to price construction. It involved specifying models in bills of quantities for various construction
projects such as a dwelling, a factory, or a bridge. For its 2005 round, the ICP changed the approach,
mainly because of the greater number of participating economies and the cost of collecting price data in
all those economies for the various models specified in previous rounds. It used the basket of construction
components (BOCC) approach instead. However, because of the problems encountered in data collection and validation a new approach was adopted for ICP 2011. It involved pricing a range of inputs
that are used in construction within each of the broad categories of labor, materials, and equipment
hire, and weighting the prices together. The initial proposal included adjustments to the input prices for
mark-ups (overheads, profits, etc.) and professional fees, but the data collected on these elements turned
out to be patchy and incomplete. Many economies did not provide these estimates, and the data that
were supplied proved to be so inconsistent that they could not be used. Therefore, the 2011 construction
PPPs for each of the regions coordinated by the Global Office were based on input prices for the three
categories weighted together. The Eurostat-OECD PPP program continues to use the bills of quantities
approach, and the CIS economies use a hybrid method that embodies some characteristics of both the
input approach and the output approach.<br><br>
More than 80 percent of economies reported details of the resource mixes―that is, the weights
needed to combine prices for labor, materials, and equipment hire. Weights were imputed for the remaining
economies, based mainly on those of similar economies. The PPPs were not adjusted for productivity
differences across economies because it was assumed that the different weights used took into account
differences in the combined labor and capital productivity―that is, total factor productivity―between
economies. In other words, the underlying assumption was that total factor productivity was constant
across economies.<br><br>
Construction PPPs for the CIS economies were linked to the Eurostat-OECD economies using Russia
as a bridge (Russia priced construction using both the bills of quantities approach and the CIS hybrid
approach). Several economies involved in the Eurostat-OECD comparison also priced the inputs specified
for the other regions, which provided a link for construction between Eurostat-OECD economies and the
rest of the world.<br><br>

At this stage, there was a matrix of 148 economies2 (Africa, 50; Asia and the Pacific, 23; Eurostat-OECD,
47; Latin America, 16; and Western Asia, 12) times 155 basic heading PPPs. Another matrix of the same
size contained 155 basic heading expenditures. A final computational step was to link regions at higher-level
aggregates and GDP. The country aggregation with redistribution (CAR) method was used for the global
aggregation, and it included the following steps:<br><br>
-A global aggregation that included all 148 economies and 155 basic headings in a GEKS computation
provided PPPs calibrated to a global currency.<br><br>
-To preserve within-region fixity, real expenditures expressed in the global currency were summed to
regional totals, which were then distributed within each region according to the distribution from
the within-region computations. These results were base countryCinvariant and transitive, and they
preserved fixity.<br><br>

	<hr><br>
	
The methods just described were used in the main ICP regions: Africa, Asia and the Pacific, CIS, Eurostat-
OECD, and Western Asia. This section is an overview of the special actions taken to increase the number of
economies included in the global comparison:<br><br>
-The CIS region was linked to the global comparison via Russia, which participated in both the CIS
and Eurostat-OECD comparisons. Because Russia was included in the Eurostat-OECD comparison,
its basic heading PPPs were linked to the rest of the world and aggregated to the world GDP
using the CAR method. Global PPPs for the CIS economies are their PPPs from the CIS comparison
(Russia = 1), multiplied by Russia’s global PPP in the global comparison.<br><br>
-The Caribbean was linked to the global comparison via the 16 Latin America economies. Cuba was
linked to the Latin America comparison via Peru for household consumption, government compensation,
machinery and equipment, and construction. For housing, Cuba was linked via República
Bolivariana de Venezuela, which has a typical housing volume index per capita for the Latin America
comparison and available dwelling stock quantity and quality data for the bilateral comparison. The
price and expenditure data used for Cuba in the calculations were expressed in convertible pesos.
-The global results contain two singleton economies that were not part of a regional comparison.
Georgia was linked to the CIS comparison through a bilateral comparison with Armenia, and the
Islamic Republic of Iran was linked to the Eurostat-OECD comparison through a bilateral comparison
with Turkey.<br><br>
-The Pacific Islands participated on a limited basis. They conducted a small price survey that covered
only household consumption. They were linked to the rest of the world through economies that
were in other regional comparisons: Fiji from the Asia and the Pacific comparison and Australia and
New Zealand from the Eurostat-OECD comparison.<br><br>
The PPPs for the CIS, Caribbean, Cuba, Pacific Islands, and singletons were not directly included in
the global aggregations as described in previous sections. Instead, they were linked to the global aggregation
in a way that had no impact on the comparisons of the other economies.<br><br>
The results for the CIS, Caribbean, Cuba, and singletons are included in the main tables. The results
for the Pacific Islands appear in supplementary table 6.8.<br><br>

	<b><a name="T20">Reliability and Limitations of PPPs and Real Expenditures</a> </b><br>
	<hr><br>
	
PPPs are statistical constructs rather than precise measures. They are point estimates that fall within some margin of error of the unknown true values. The error margins surrounding PPPs depend on the reliability of the expenditure weights and the price data reported by the participating economies as well as the extent to which the goods and services priced reflect the consumption patterns and price levels of each participating economy. The margins of error around PPPs are the result of sampling and nonsampling errors, plus the inherent variability in price and economic structures between economies.<br><br>
Sampling errors are the results of three of the steps taken to collect prices and calculate basic heading PPPs. First, a sample of products is selected for pricing rather than pricing the universe of products. Second, a sample of outlets is selected rather than including every outlet in the economy in the price surveys. Third, prices from the sample of outlets are generally observed monthly, quarterly, or annually, depending on the seasonal variability in the prices. Although selection of the sample of products and outlets is a subjective process involving expert judgment, sampling theory can be used to determine the number of products to be priced, the number of outlets to be selected for the price surveys, and the number of times prices are observed for each selected product.<br><br>
Chapter 7 of Measuring the Real Size of the World Economy (World Bank 2013) provides measures of the sources of sampling error. Table 7.3 shows that only about 10C15 rice products need to be priced compared with 70C100 for garments and 50+ for pharmaceutical products to obtain about the same level of precision of the estimated basic heading PPPs. Products such as rice, milk, and eggs are very homogeneous, whereas the garment basic heading, which includes clothing for men, women, and children, is very heterogeneous. The desired degree of precision is also dependent on the relative expenditure shares of each basic heading. PPPs for basic headings with a large share of the GDP need to be measured with greater precision than those with small shares. In general, the sampling errors of the basic heading PPPs are mostly kept below 10 percent by increasing the number of products and prices where there is greater variability.<br><br>
A nonsampling error is one that cannot be reduced by increasing the number of products surveyed or the number of prices observed. It also can be considered a source of bias. The weights to aggregate basic heading PPPs to GDP depend on the coverage and completeness of the national accounts. The per capita

<a href= "link08.html">在不平等世界要包容</a><br><br>
<a href= "link09.html">匹克迪 《二十一世纪资本论》</a><br><br>


measures are dependent on the reliability of the population numbers, and the PLIs are dependent on the accuracy
of the exchange rates as well as the PPPs. The need for national average prices can be difficult to meet in
large economies with large rural areas and population. Product specifications can be vague, which means that
economies may not price the same products. These nonsampling errors and sources of bias are minimized by
the exhaustive data validation process described in chapter 9 of Measuring the Real Size of the World Economy
(World Bank 2013) and chapters 13C21 in the ICP Operational Guidelines and Procedures for Measuring the
Real Size of the World Economy (draft version, http://go.worldbank.org/YIR7WSNL40).<br><br>
The reliability of the aggregated PPPs is affected not only by sampling and nonsampling errors, but
also by the underlying variability inherent in each economy’s price and economic structure. The relative price
of rice as shown by the basic heading PPP for rice may be very cheap in an economy in which other relative
prices for other basic headings are relatively expensive. The basic heading PPPs of an economy to the base will
differ from each other by factors of 20 for most basic headings and much more for those difficult to measure.
This source of variability does not mean there are errors. Rather, it is an example of the variability of PPPs
across economies with wide differences in economic and price structures. The variability of basic heading PPPs
diminishes when comparing economies of similar price and economic structures, which is the main reason
PPPs are first computed at the regional level.<br><br>




Another source of variability in aggregated PPPs arises from the variation in the basic heading expenditure
weights. Recall that the PPPs between any pair of economies are aggregated to GDP first using
economy A’s weights (Laspeyres index) and then using economy B’s weights (Paasche index). The Laspeyres
and Paasche indexes result in different estimates of the PPPs and real expenditures of each economy.
The geometric mean is then taken, which is the Fisher index. The variability around the Fisher index is
approximated by the Paasche-Laspeyres ratio or spread. An analysis by Deaton (2012) has shown that these
standard errors for economies similar to the United States―Canada, for example―are about 2.5 percent.
For less similar economies, such as China and India, they are around 7 percent and over 10 percent for
several CIS economies.
<br><br>


The Fisher indexes are not transitive or base economyCinvariant. Therefore, the GEKS method is used
for the final calculation. The aggregated PPP between France and Germany is the direct PPP between France
and Germany times the geometric mean of the indirect PPPs through the n- 2 other economies in the comparison.
Because of the transitivity requirement, the price level of the direct comparison between France and
Germany must also be the same as the PPP from the entire chain of economies―that is, from the United
States to India to Tajikistan, etc., through all economies in the comparison. Although the multilateral GEKS
method produces results satisfying transitivity and base economy invariance, the relative standard errors
increase for comparisons of similar economies such as the United States with its major trading partners. The
relative standard error of the India and China PPPs to U.S. PPPs just described could increase to 15 percent
from the multilateral comparison, although in practice this is likely to be somewhat lower because of fixity.

	<b><a name="T21">Limitations in the Use of 2011 PPPs</a> </b><br>
	<hr><br>
	
Anyone comparing economies by the size of their real GDP or their real GDP per capita should do so cautiously.
Such comparisons require that all the economies employ the same definition of GDP and that their
measurement of GDP is equally exhaustive. Although the first requirement is broadly met because the GDP
estimates of most ICP participants are compiled more or less in line with SNA 93, the measurement of GDP
is not sufficiently uniform over all participants to satisfy the second requirement. In particular, the GDPs of
<a href= "link08.html">在不平等世界要包容</a><br><br>
<a href= "link09.html">匹克迪 《二十一世纪资本论》</a><br><br>


participants with large non-observed economies could be underestimated. Bearing in mind that there may be
errors in the population data in addition to those in the price and expenditure data, one should not consider
small differences between real GDPs and real GDPs per capita significant.<br><br>
ICP 2011 includes economies ranging from city-states and small islands to large and diverse economies
such as Brazil, China, India, Russia, South Africa, and the United States. Because of the wide differences in the
price and economic structures of economies and the inherent statistical variability in the methods used to calculate
PPPs, the following guidelines are recommended for those using the 2011 PPPs and real expenditures.<br><br>
-Comparisons between economies that are similar will be more precise than comparisons between
economies that are dissimilar. For example, the PPP between Nigeria and South Africa will be more
precise than the PPP of either economy to Liberia or Zimbabwe. Comparisons between economies
in the same region will be more precise than those between economies in other regions. For example,
the China-India comparison will be more precise than the comparison of either to the United States.<br><br>
-PPPs based on the prices of goods will be more precise than PPPs based on the prices of services.<br><br>
Areas such as housing and health care will have wider measures of error than those for food products.<br><br>
-PPPs provide the overall price level of an economy, but do not capture price differences within an
economy.<br><br>
Because of the sampling errors and statistical errors arising from the calculation methods, differences
in real GDP of less than 5 percent should not be considered significant. This margin of error can rise to plus
or minus 15 percent for economies that differ widely in their price and economic structures. This should be
kept in mind when using, for example, the PPPs of the United States, China, India, and Brazil to compare
the countries not only with each other but also with those of more disparate economies such as most of the
African economies.<br><br>

	<b><a name="T22">Correct Usage of 2011 PPPs</a> </b><br>
	<hr><br>
	
Linked to reliability is correct usage. PPPs appear in international trade theory in the context of equilibrium
exchange rates (the underlying rates of exchange to which actual exchange rates are assumed to converge in
the long term). But ICP PPPs should not be interpreted as equilibrium exchange rates because they do not
refer solely to domestically produced goods valued at export prices. They have been calculated specifically to
enable comparisons of international prices and real expenditures for GDP. They refer to the entire range of
goods and services that make up GDP and include many items that are not traded internationally. Moreover,
except for exports and imports, they are valued at domestic market prices and are calculated using expenditure
weights that reflect domestic demand. For the same reason, ICP PPPs do not indicate whether a currency is
undervalued or overvalued and should not be used for this purpose.<br><br>
ICP comparisons are designed to compare the volumes of goods and services that enter GDP at specific
points in time. They are not designed to measure the relative rates of growth in GDP between these points.<br><br>
Each ICP comparison produces indexes of real GDP that show the relative volume levels of GDP among
participating economies for the reference year. When the indexes for consecutive reference years are placed
side by side, they appear to provide points in a time series of relative GDP volume levels over the intervening
years. This apparent time series of volume measures is actually a time series of value indexes because the volume indexes for each reference year are calculated with the prices and expenditures of that year. Changes in
the volume indexes between reference years are thus due to changes in relative price levels as well as changes in
relative volume levels. As a result, the rates of relative growth derived from the indexes are not consistent with
those obtained from GDP volumes estimated by the economies themselves. The rates of growth estimated by
the economies should be used to determine the relative rates of growth in GDP.<br><br>
The PLIs for the household final consumption expenditure provide a measure of the differences in the
cost of living between economies―that is, they indicate whether the overall price level for consumer goods
and services faced by the average household in one economy is higher or lower than that faced by the average
household in another economy. Even so, people considering moving from one economy to another should
not use these PLIs to infer how the change of economy will affect their cost of living. For one thing, the PLIs
reflect the expenditure pattern of the average household, which in all likelihood is different from that of the
person contemplating the move. For another, the PLIs are national averages and do not reflect differences in
the cost of living between specific locations.<br><br>

	<b><a name="T23">Reliability of PPPs for Poverty Analysis</a> </b><br>
	<hr><br>
	
Global poverty numbers require a large and varied set of data collected from different places, time periods,
and sources. Five unique data sources are required for the World Bank’s calculation of global poverty numbers
and global poverty lines: household surveys, population censuses, national accounts, consumer price indexes,
and PPPs from the ICP. Each new round of the ICP brings revisions of the PPPs, and these revisions, like
revisions of the other data sources, can have large effects on global, regional, and national poverty counts. The
global poverty line itself is calculated as an average of the PPP equivalents of the poverty lines of the world’s
poorest economies. In general, therefore, the global line will also change with new PPPs, even if the underlying
national poverty lines remain unchanged.<br><br>
The consumption PPPs generated by ICP 2011 are designed to match the national account estimates of
consumption, and the weights used to construct them are the shares of each good or service in the aggregate
consumption expenditure. The use of those PPPs for poverty measurement has sometimes been criticized on
the grounds that people who live at or below the global poverty line have different patterns of consumption
than the aggregates in the national accounts. In particular, they spend a much larger share of their budgets on
food, and they spend very little on housing and essentially nothing at all on air travel or on financial services
indirectly measured, just to take one example.<br><br>
PPPs offer comparisons across economies, not across the rich and poor within economies. As a consequence,
in comparisons of any two economies the shift from aggregate to “poor” weights should have roughly
the same effect in both economies so that, if the prices are the same in the aggregate and “poor” comparisons,
the PPPs are not much affected. There are some exceptions, however, such as in economies that have extensive
food subsidies so that the poor pay lower prices. There would be more exceptions if the prices paid by the
poor were systematically different from the average prices in a way that differed from one economy to another.
There have been some attempts to measure such price differences, but there is no general agreement on how
to do so, or on whether such differences are important. Thus, additional research will be necessary before
international poverty rates can be estimated using the ICP PPPs.<br><br>

	<b><a name="T24">Comparing the ICP 2005 and ICP 2011 Benchmark Results</a> </b><br>
	<hr><br>
	
The ICP is designed to compare levels of economic activity across economies, expressed in a common currency,
in a particular benchmark year. The results of the ICP should not be used to compare changes in an
economy’s GDP volume over time; the national accounts volume estimates of each individual economy are
the best data source for this purpose. The 2005 and 2011 ICP comparisons are the first two that include comparable
real expenditures for such a large number of economies. With the release of the ICP 2011 results, it
is inevitable that the positions of economies in 2011 will be compared with those in 2005 by simultaneously
studying changes over time and across economies. However, many of the comparisons will be problematical
because they will be based on two different price levels, and so real expenditures and PLIs will not be directly
comparable between 2005 and 2011. In addition, some of the economies participating in one of these comparisons
did not participate in the other comparison; a small number of economies moved from one region
to another; and, most important, some significant changes in methodology were implemented in ICP 2011.<br><br>
Indeed, the methodological changes between 2005 and 2011 will have an effect on any
comparisons between them. The major methodological changes in ICP 2011 are as follows:<br><br>
-Global linking and aggregation. The 2011 linking procedures differed from those used in 2005 in
two important respects:<br><br>
At the basic heading level. In 2005 only 18 economies participated in the Ring, a special group of
representative economies from ICP regions that priced a common list of products (the Ring list)
to be used in linking, whereas in 2011 almost all participating economies contributed to the
interregional linking by pricing products in the global core list, the worldwide list of products
designed to provide links between regions.<br><br>
At the aggregate levels above the basic heading. In 2011 a new method, country aggregation with
redistribution or CAR, was implemented in place of the 2005 super-region method, in which
linking factors were computed for regional aggregates.<br><br>
The change in methods was based on the outcome of an analysis of the 2005 results, which
showed that the linking factors were overly sensitive to pricing problems in the Ring economies.
The 2011 methodology is considered an improvement over the 2005 linking method both at the
basic heading level and above.<br><br>
-Calculating basic heading PPPs. In 2005 basic heading PPPs were calculated using the CPD method
without assigning any weight at the product level. In 2011 it was decided that products would be
classified as important or less important and that weights of 3:1 would be used in computing basic
heading PPPs at the intra-region level and also in estimating linking factors. Thus basic heading
PPPs were calculated using the CPD-W method. The classification and weighting of products by
their relative importance will affect the 2011 PPPs compared with those from the 2005 ICP round.<br><br>
-Dwellings. In 2005 Africa and the CIS used the dwelling stock approach, Latin America the rental
approach, and Asia and the Pacific the reference volume approach, whereas Eurostat-OECD and
Western Asia used a combination of rental and dwelling stock data. The regional results were linked using the dwelling stock data. In 2011 the Africa, Latin America, Caribbean, and Western Asia
regions calculated PPPs using rental data collected for the global list of dwelling types; Asia and the
Pacific used the reference volume approach; the CIS used dwelling stock data; and Eurostat-OECD
used a combination of rental and dwelling stock data. Linking was carried out in stages. The Africa,
Latin America, Caribbean, and Western Asia regions were linked using the same rental data that
went into the estimation of their intra-region PPPs. For Asia and the Pacific, the CIS, and Eurostat-
OECD, dwelling stock data were used to link them to each other and then to the rest of the world.<br><br>
-Government. In 2005 government consumption estimates were adjusted for productivity differences
between economies in three of the six regions―Africa, Asia and the Pacific, and Western Asia―
but the regional linking factors were computed without any productivity adjustments. In 2011
the Africa, Asia and the Pacific, Latin America, and Caribbean regions used productivity adjustments
when computing their regional results, but no productivity adjustments were applied in the
Eurostat-OECD, CIS, and Western Asia regions. The linking factors for all regions were computed
with productivity adjustments to produce the global results.<br><br>
-Construction. The method used to estimate construction PPPs changed completely in 2011 and
is not comparable with that used in 2005. In ICP 2005, construction PPPs were estimated using
the BOCC approach. Because of the difficulties encountered in implementing this approach, a
simplified input method based on the prices of basic materials, labor, and machinery was adopted
for ICP 2011.<br><br>
Aside from the methodological changes, directly comparing the ICP estimates of real expenditures for
2011 with those for 2005 is not desirable. Not only did price levels change between 2005 and 2011, but they
changed to a different extent across economies. Even comparing the relative positions of economies can be misleading
when world or regional averages are used as the basis for comparison. For example, in the Asia and the
Pacific region whose economic activity is dominated by China, the relationship between the real expenditure
of one of the high-income economies such as Hong Kong SAR, China and the regional average will decline
between 2005 and 2011, even though Hong Kong SAR, China’s real GDP rose appreciably between those two
years. The reason is that the regional average real expenditure on GDP increased even more than Hong Kong
SAR, China’s real GDP because of the dominance in the region of the rapidly growing Chinese economy.<br><br>

PPPs can be extrapolated at any level, ranging from the most detailed level, the basic heading level, up to
total GDP. Extrapolating at the more detailed levels is likely to produce better results when compared with
successive benchmarks, but it is more likely that an approach based on extrapolating at fairly broad levels will
generally be used in practice because of the lack of detailed price deflators that are consistent across economies.
The methods used to produce the national accounts estimates that provide the basis for extrapolating PPPs
can differ significantly from one economy to another, thereby affecting the reliability of extrapolations. For
example, economies differ in the ways in which they treat productivity changes over time, in how they update
their national accounts to take account of revised data or the introduction of new methodology, and in the
methods they use to adjust price deflators for quality change.<br><br>


The most common method used to interpolate PPPs and real expenditures between ICP benchmarks
and to extrapolate from the most recent one, the latest set of benchmark PPPs for each economy, is a time
series of price deflators at a broad level (typically, GDP but sometimes a handful of major components of
GDP). The process involves comparing changes in national accounts deflators for an economy with those in a
base economy and using these comparative movements to extrapolate from the latest ICP benchmark. Some
very restrictive assumptions underlie this method, the most important of which is that the economies have
similar economic structures and are evolving in a similar way. Clearly, this is not the case when developing
economies are compared with the United States, which is regularly used as the base economy. Changes in an
economy’s terms of trade also can have a significant effect on the consistency of extrapolated PPPs and real
expenditures. In addition, the global financial crisis in 2008C09 affected economies very differently, with some
economies, mainly high-income ones, falling into a recession for a year or more, while others continued to
grow despite the financial crisis.<br><br>
Several assumptions relate to the consistency of the methods used to estimate an economy’s national
accounts with those used by the ICP. For example, the products priced by the ICP are carefully defined to
ensure comparability between economies, but the products priced in the time series used in estimating the
volumes in an economy’s national accounts are selected to ensure that they are the most representative products
available in the economy. In addition, the weighting patterns used in an economy’s price indexes are
specific to that economy, whereas those underlying the ICP results are an amalgam of those for the economies
participating in the ICP. The prices in an economy’s price indexes, such as the consumer price index (CPI),
are adjusted for quality changes over time, and economies do not use common methods to adjust for these
changes. For example, hedonic methods are used to a different extent in different economies, or not at all in
many economies, with the result that the quality-adjusted time series are not consistent across economies.<br><br>
Many economies use chain-linked volumes in their time series because of the distortions introduced
by using a fixed base year for volume estimates for a lengthy period of time. As a result, the GDP deflators
derived from chain-linked volumes behave differently from those for economies that use the more traditional
fixed-base methods to estimate their GDP volumes. In practice, fixed-base volumes tend to be biased upward
for the most recent years, which means that any deflators derived from them are biased downward.<br><br>
Experience has shown that sizable discrepancies can arise between extrapolated estimates and a new
benchmark, even when they are only a couple of years apart. The gap between the latest ICP rounds was six
years, which resulted in some very large differences for many economies between the extrapolated real expenditures
for 2011 and the benchmark real expenditures that have become available from ICP 2011. It is not
possible to quantify separately the various factors underlying these differences.<br><br>
A detailed explanation of the issues underlying extrapolation is available in chapter 18 of Measuring the
Real Size of the World Economy (World Bank 2013).<br><br>
