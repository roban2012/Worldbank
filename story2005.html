<a href= "story02.html">Summary of Results and Findings of the 2011 International Comparison Program(@ 2014)</a><br><br>

This publication presents the results of the 2005 International
Comparison Program (ICP), which was led and
coordinated by the World Bank during 2003C08. The size
and complexity of this important statistical project made
it imperative to distribute the tasks by geographic regions.<br><br>
Data collection was overseen by regional coordinating agencies,
which compiled the results and produced regional estimates
of purchasing power parities (PPPs). Throughout the
process, the regional coordinators worked closely with the
ICP global office at the World Bank. The strong partnership
with the Eurostat-OECD and its parallel program made it
possible to combine the results from the two efforts for this
publication.<br><br>

<a href= "link09.html">匹克迪 《二十一世纪资本论》</a><br><br>

The final step of the ICP has been the linking of regional
results into a global data set so that economic activity and
price levels can be compared between economies in different
regions. These global results were produced using a
new technique known as the “ring comparison.” This publication
comprises the results for 146 economies obtained
through this linking process. The number of participating
economies far exceeds that of previous rounds.<br><br>
On behalf of the World Bank and the ICP Executive
Board, we would like to thank all those who have contributed
to making the 2005 ICP such a resounding success.<br><br>
It has been a great team effort. We cannot give credit, in
this limited space, to all of the individuals responsible for
its successful completion. Many are listed in the acknowledgments
that follow. Here we would like to highlight the
efforts of some special groups.<br><br>
We are very pleased to say that the program has greatly
benefited from the overwhelming support it received from
national statistical offices and other participating agencies.<br><br>
The success of such a huge and complex undertaking
depends critically on the active cooperation of the agencies
involved in collecting the data in each economy. Some
of the processes we used were new and untested, and the
spirit in which everyone tackled the problems that inevitably
arose in the course of this groundbreaking work has
been truly gratifying.<br><br>
We would especially like to thank the staff of the regional
coordinating agencies―namely, the African Development
Bank (AfDB), the Asian Development Bank (ADB), Statistics
Canada, the Economic Commission for Latin America
and the Caribbean (ECLAC), the Economic and Social
Commission for Western Asia (ESCWA), the Statistical
Office of the Commonwealth of Independent States (CISSTAT),
the Federal State Statistics Service of the Russian
Federation (Rosstat), and the Bureau of Economic Analysis
(Moscow)―which have invested so much effort into setting
up regional product lists, training statistical office staff
in the concepts underlying PPPs, and addressing the practical
issues associated with collecting and editing the data	


and compiling the PPPs and related statistics for each of
the regions. We also want to thank Eurostat and OECD for
providing their experience, expertise, and overall support
for the regional and ring comparisons.<br><br>
When the United Nations Statistical Commission gave
the go-ahead to this ICP round at its 2002 meeting, it
emphasized that the project had to have a strong governance
structure. The Executive Board was set up to provide
this governance. The Board and its members have had a
major impact on the program, and we would like to thank
them all for their contributions.<br><br>
The project would not have been such a success without
the invaluable inputs from members of the Technical
Advisory Group. We appreciate the wholehearted and
enthusiastic manner in which they conducted their various
discussions―both at meetings in Washington and via
emails.<br><br>

Our special thanks go to the major donors, whose contributions
were so important in bringing the program to
fruition. Contributors to the Global Trust Fund include
the U.K. Department for International Development, the
International Monetary Fund, the Australian Agency for
International Development, and the United Nations Development
Programme. The World Bank made significant contributions
to both the global and regional programs, as did
numerous regional agencies.<br><br>
We would like to congratulate the global office team
at the World Bank. They have faced many challenges and
obstacles over the past four years or so, but their perseverance
and unwavering commitment to the project have
ultimately helped them overcome all the odds. They have
succeeded not only in producing a very important set of
statistical indicators but also in refining important concepts
underlying international comparisons, developing new tools
to make data collection and compilation easier and more
transparent, and setting up a firm basis on which future
ICPs can be launched.<br><br>
We hope that users will find the report useful. These
data represent the most comprehensive survey of prices
ever undertaken. As with any statistical exercise, there are
limitations to the data, and these are highlighted in the
report. We welcome any comments and suggestions for
their improvement.<br><br>
Finally, to everyone involved in this enormous task,
thanks very much for a job well done!<br><br>

Introduction: The International Comparison Program and Purchasing Power Parities
<a href= "pic05.html">2005 ICP Global Results: Summary Table</a><br><br>
<a href= "pic20.html">2005, Table 1 World shares of GDP</a><br><br>

The International Comparison Program<br><br>
The International Comparison Program (commonly known
as the “ICP”) is a worldwide statistical initiative to collect
comparative price data and estimate purchasing power parities
(PPPs) of the world’s economies. Using PPPs instead of
market exchange rates to convert currencies makes it possible
to compare the output of economies and the welfare
of their inhabitants in real terms (that is, controlling for
differences in price levels).<br><br>
The System of National Accounts, 1993 (SNA93) provides
a common international framework for the measurement
of economic activity. Gross domestic product (GDP)
is the measure most often used to quantify economies’ economic
activity, and GDP and consumption per capita are
basic indicators of economic productivity and well-being.<br><br>
But the conversion of output or expenditures, measured
in the local currency of one economy, to a common unit of
account for comparison or aggregation with that of other
economies is not a trivial problem. The standard method
has been to use market exchange rates. However, market
exchange rates are determined by the demand for, and supply
of, currencies used in international transactions. They
do not necessarily reflect differences in price levels and may
therefore under- or overstate the real value of an economy’s
output and the standard of living of its residents. In fact, the
prices of many goods and services within economies are
determined in partial or complete isolation from the rest
of the world. Therefore, SNA93 recommends that the real
value of economic activity be determined using purchasing
power parities. The need for a more meaningful tool for
comparing the real domestic product between economies
led to the creation of the International Comparison Program
(ICP) in 1968 and the publication of PPP estimates in
1970. The increasing use of PPPs by researchers, businesses,
and international institutions has made the ICP a truly
global program now covering more than 140 economies.<br><br>
This report brings together the results of two separate
PPP programs. The first is the global ICP program conducted
by the ICP global office within the World Bank, which provided
overall coordination for the collection of data and
calculation of PPPs in more than 100 (mostly developing)
economies. The program was organized into five geographic
areas: Africa, Asia-Pacific, Commonwealth of Independent
States, South America, and Western Asia. Regional agencies
took the lead in coordinating the work in the five regions.<br><br>
In parallel, the Statistical Office of the European Communities
(Eurostat) and the Organisation for Economic
Co-operation and Development (OECD) conducted
their 2005 PPP program, which comprised 46 economies.<br><br>
<a href= "link03.html">德国人偏爱俄罗斯</a><br><br>

Eurostat covered 37 economies: the 25 European Union
(EU) member states; the European Free Trade Association
(EFTA) economies (Iceland, Norway, and Switzerland); and
Albania, Bosnia-Herzegovina, Bulgaria, Croatia, Macedonia,
Montenegro, Romania, Serbia, and Turkey. The OECD
part of the program included 9 other economies: Australia,
Canada, Israel, Japan, the Republic of Korea, Mexico, New
Zealand, the Russian Federation, and the United States.<br><br>
The main reasons for conducting the ICP on a regional
basis are that the products to be priced are more homogeneous
within regions, the expenditure patterns are likely
to be more similar, and language differences are reduced.<br><br>
Moreover, dividing the ICP organization among a number
of regional offices in relatively close proximity to the economies
they are coordinating provides operational benefits.<br><br>
The ICP global office has combined the results from
each of the five regions with those from the Eurostat-
OECD PPP program into an overall global comparison, so
that results for all participating economies can be compared
directly. The ring comparison (described on page 159, was
developed specifically to link the regional PPPs without
changing the relative results within a region (see page 163,
“Fixity”). In other words, the starting point was the final
results computed by each region. The ring comparison provided
regional scalars by which economies’ data at each
level of aggregation were converted to a global level (that
is, the relative comparisons between economies within a
region remained the same in the global comparison). For
that reason, the global PPP results were not reviewed by
national statistical authorities before publication.<br><br>
(Appendix A provides a more detailed overview of
the history of the ICP and its relationship to the Eurostat-
OECD program. Appendix B describes the governance and
the management of the ICP and how that related to the
Eurostat-OECD program. Appendix C shows the Eurostat-
OECD classification of expenditures on the GDP used by
both programs as a starting point to select products to be
priced and also as the basis for the first level at which PPPs
are estimated.)<br><br>

	<b><a name="T4">Purchasing Power Parity</a> </b><br>
	<hr><br>
<a href= "link01.html">Abbreviations</a><br><br>
	
A purchasing power parity between two countries, A and
B, is the ratio of the number of units of country A’s currency
needed to purchase in country A the same quantity
of a specific good or service as one unit of country B’s currency
will purchase in country B. PPPs can be expressed in
the currency of either of the countries. In practice, they are
usually computed among large numbers of countries and
expressed in terms of a single currency, with the U.S. dollar
(US$) most commonly used as the base or “numeraire”
currency.<br><br>
Take the familiar “Big Mac Index” as an example. If a
Big Mac hamburger costs 4.00 U.S. dollars in the United
States and 4.80 euros in France, then the PPP for a Big Mac
from the French viewpoint is 0.83 U.S. dollars to the euro.
From the American viewpoint, it is 1.20 euros to the U.S.
dollar. This means that for every euro spent on Big Macs in
France, it would be necessary to spend 0.83 U.S. dollars in
the United States to obtain the same quantity and quality
of Big Macs. Conversely, for every U.S. dollar spent on Big
Macs in the United States, it would be necessary to spend
1.20 euros in France to obtain the same quantity and quality
of Big Macs.<br><br>
The Big Mac is a single, standard product. The aim of the
ICP is to produce PPPs that take into account the relative
prices among many countries for a broad range of goods
and services, including not only consumer products but
also capital and government expenditures, which together
make up GDP.<br><br>

	<br>
	<b><a name="T5">Price Level Indexes</a> </b><br>
	<hr><br>
	
Comparing PPPs at the level of GDP with market exchange
rates provides a measure of the average cost of goods and
services in one economy when purchased using currencies
converted at prevailing exchange rates. The ratio of a PPP
to a corresponding market exchange rate is called a price
level index (PLI). A PLI of 100 indicates that price levels
are the same as those in the base country or the world average.<br><br>
The PLI with the United States = 100 is simply the
PPP divided by the exchange rate to the United States. The
PLI with the world = 100 is the PLI to the United States
multiplied by the ratio of the world total PPP expenditures
to world total exchange rate expenditures for each level of
aggregation. The detailed data tables show the PLI for the
world = 100 to remove the effect of the exchange rate of
the U.S. dollar.<br><br>
Returning to the Big Mac example, if the market
exchange rate is 1.00 U.S. dollar to 0.67 euros, then the
PLI for a Big Mac with the United States as the base is
179 (1.20/0.67*100). This indicates that given the relative

purchasing power of the U.S. dollar and the euro, a Big Mac
costs 79 percent more in France than in the United States.
Travelers exchanging their dollars to euros would notice
this immediately.<br><br>
PPPs between any pair of countries change slowly,
whereas market exchange rates can change quickly. Sudden
changes in PLIs result mainly from changes in market
exchange rates. When market exchange rates change rapidly,
a PLI for a country could change too in a short time, indicating
that a country that was relatively cheap has now become
relatively expensive compared with the base country.<br><br>

	<b><a name="T6">The Use of PPPs and Market Exchange Rates for International Comparisons</a> </b><br>
	<hr><br>

PPPs are the preferred means of converting the value of
the GDP and its components to a common currency. They
enable cross-country comparisons of the sizes of economies,
average consumption levels, poverty rates, productivity,
and the use of resources. However, PPPs should not be
used for all international comparisons; for example, market
exchange rates should be used to measure international
trade, capital flows, or the values of foreign debt.<br><br>
PPPs adjust for differences in price levels between
economies, which may not be reflected in market exchange
rates, at least in the short run. Market exchange rates are
the prices at which currencies trade in international markets.<br><br>
Because developing economies tend to have relatively
lower wages leading to lower prices for nontraded goods
and services, a unit of local currency has greater purchasing
power within a developing economy than it does in
the global market. Consequently, the GDP of a developing
economy and the consumption of its residents will
typically be underestimated if market exchange rates are
used to compare their value with those of high-income
economies. Although differences in price levels are generally
less pronounced among economies at similar levels of
development, large and rapid movements of exchange rates
can alter the apparent size of economies or the perceived
welfare of their residents. For example, the Euro exchange
rate has changed from US$ 0.853 in October 2000 to US$
1.562 in March 2008, but that does not mean that the welfare
of Euro area countries has changed accordingly in relation
to the United States in that time.<br><br>
There is no need to convert from national currencies to
a common currency (whether by market exchange rates or
PPPs) when calculating growth rates for a single economy.
However, in computing regional (or world) growth rates, the
sizes of the economies matter: national GDPs and aggregates
are first converted to a common currency and then summed
to regional (or world) totals, from which growth rates are
computed. The appropriate conversion factor is provided
by PPPs. Developing economies have often had (at least
in the past decade) higher rates of economic growth than
developed economies. As a result, the global growth rates
computed with PPP-based activity levels tend to be higher
than those computed using market exchange rates. The reason
is that the developing economies have a higher weight
in the PPP-based regional totals (both levels and growth
rates) than those based on market exchange rates.<br><br>
The initial rounds of the ICP in the 1970s focused
mainly on what are referred to as “volumes” or “real expenditures”
of GDP, its major components, and their per capita
estimates. PPPs were seen mainly as providing a steppingstone
from national accounts expressed in national currencies
to volumes expressed in a common currency. In recent
times, economic analysts have shown increasing interest in
PPPs in their own right as a measure of relative price levels
between economies.<br><br>
A major use of the PPP results is the estimation of the
widely used “dollar-a-day” international poverty threshold.
PPP results also enter the estimation of the United Nations
Human Development Index and Gender Empowerment
Measure, allow the World Health Organization to use health
expenditures per capita to assess health inequality across
economies, and provide the basis for international organizations
to design effective aid programs. The European
Commission relies on PPP-based indicators to allocate the
Structural and Cohesion Funds across member economies.<br><br>
Purchasing power measures are also useful for policy
makers at the national level. For example, with the internationally
comparable data, policy makers can draw on the
experience of other economies by comparing the data for
the components of the GDP and their relationship to economic
growth. Similar analyses can inform policy makers
of their economy’s comparative advantage by examining
which goods or services are relatively cheap or expensive
compared with those of other economies.<br><br>
Purchasing power parities allow comparisons between
economies of expenditure shares or price levels for components
such as food, health care, and investments. For
example, capital goods tend to be relatively more expensive

than consumer goods in developing economies, while services
tend to be cheaper. Comparisons between economies
at this level provide another view of what is contributing to
differences in growth rates between economies.<br><br>
The PPP-based measures of the GDP are needed to
compare volume measures with other economic variables.
Examples include the following:<br><br>
-Carbon emissions per unit of GDP<br><br>
-Energy use per unit of GDP<br><br>
-GDP per employee<br><br>
-GDP per hour worked<br><br>
The first two are useful for environmental comparisons,
while the latter two provide important comparisons of
productivity.<br><br>

	<br>
	<b><a name="T7">Reliability of PPPs and GDP Volume Measures</a> </b><br>
	<hr><br>
	
Purchasing power parities are statistical estimates. Like all
statistics, they are point estimates that fall within some
margin of error of the unknown, true values. The error
margins surrounding the PPPs depend on the reliability of
the expenditure weights and the price data and how well
the goods and services that were priced represent the consumption
pattern and price levels of each participating
economy. As with national accounts data generally, it is not
possible to calculate precise error margins for PPPs or the
real expenditure data derived from them.<br><br>
The 2005 ICP included economies ranging from citystates
to large and diverse countries such as China, India,
and Indonesia, which collectively account for more than
40 percent of the world’s population and include many
people living in remote, rural locations. These and similar
economies had to produce national average prices for
goods and services that were comparable with those of
other economies in their region. The accuracy of the PPPs
for these economies depends upon the extent to which the
selected goods and services were representative of their
entire economy and on their ability to provide nationally
representative average prices. The need to measure prices
for internationally comparable goods and services means
that they are more likely to reflect consumption patterns of
urban areas. It is also true that many household goods and
services are available only in towns, so the urban and rural
prices become the same. If the urban-to-rural price differentials
are similar across economies, any bias will tend to
cancel out in the estimation of PPPs; if not, results for some
economies may be biased, up or down, depending on the
extent of over- or underrepresentation of urban and rural
areas. Additional detail about estimating PPPs for large
economies follows in box 1.<br><br>
<a href= "link10.html">格林斯潘：中国经济高增长是借来的</a><br><br>


To minimize this potential bias, each ICP region prepared
its own list of goods and services to be priced so that
they would better reflect the characteristics of the economies
in its region. The need to deal with the wide diversity
of sizes, urbanization, and performance of economies
in each region was considered at every step leading to the
estimation of PPPs.<br><br>
Therefore, caution should be used when comparing
economies by the size of their GDP or in per capita expenditures.<br><br>
Mindful that there may be errors in the calculation
of GDP and population sizes, as well as in the estimation
of PPPs, small differences should not be considered significant.<br><br>
It is generally accepted that differences in GDP of
less than 5 percent lie within the margin of error of the
PPP estimation. Rather than ranking economies, it is preferable
to group economies by broad size categories. Caution
should also be exercised about making comparisons
of price levels or per capita expenditures at low levels of
aggregation, where small errors may lead to large discrepancies.<br><br>
Some areas such as housing and health are more
difficult to measure, and services in general are more difficult
to price than are goods; therefore, comparisons of these
components have wider measures of error than those for
food products.<br><br>
PPPs should not be used as indicators of the under- or
overvaluation of currencies, nor should they be interpreted
as equilibrium exchange rates. The PPPs cover all of GDP
valued at purchaser’s prices, which include both traded and
nontraded goods. Exchange rates, unlike PPPs, reflect the
demand for currencies as a medium of exchange, speculative
investments, or official reserves. Exchange rates should
be used to price international transactions and to make
comparisons between economies of international debt, the
flow of international capital, and the export and import of
goods and services.<br><br>
The PPPs in this report are not comparable with previous
PPPs published by the World Bank in the World Development
Indicators (WDI) or other publications

The 2005 PPPs are derived from a global program of price
surveys carried out using similar methods in 146 economies.<br><br>
The previous benchmark estimates were based on surveys
carried out between 1993 and 1996 in a limited number
of developing economies and on more recent surveys in
OECD and CIS economies conducted in 2002 and 2000,
respectively. Many economies were included for the first
time in 2005, including China. Previous estimates of China’s
PPPs came from a research study using data for 1986.<br><br>
India participated for the first time since 1985. Because of
the old vintage of Indian data, a regression was used instead
for the PPP estimate in the WDI (for the methodology, see
“Estimation of PPPs for nonbenchmark economies”). Since
the last round of price collections, PPPs have been extrapolated
forward using ratios of price indexes (either GDP
deflators or consumer price indexes). In addition, the new
2005 PPPs are based on a different methodology designed
to overcome problems encountered in previous rounds of
the ICP. Therefore, users should be cautious about making
comparisons with previous estimates of PPP-based GDP
and components. What can be said is that the new ICP
results substantially revise our view of the world economy.<br><br>
(Additional detail about the comparability with previous
estimates is contained in appendix G.)<br><br>
The overall ICP was designed and conducted to provide
comparable results between economies across different
regions. However, because of the difficulties of measuring
housing and government compensation, different methods
were used to compute housing PPPs in Asia-Pacific and
Africa and government PPPs in Asia-Pacific, Africa, and
Western Asia from those used in the other regions.
(Appendixes F and G provide a detailed overview of the
methodological differences that may affect comparability
of the new results with those from the past, as well as comparisons
between regions.)<br><br>
PPPs provide a measure of the overall price level of an
economy, but they may not reflect the expenditure patterns
of the poor. Nor do they capture differences in price
levels within an economy. Additional data and analysis will
be necessary before international poverty rates can be estimated;
direct application of these PPPs to the estimation of
poverty levels and rates may yield misleading results.<br><br>

Obtaining national prices for a list of comparable products
poses special problems for large, diverse economies and especially
those with large, rural populations. The sample sizes and
number of data collection centers required to collect the data
needed to estimate national average prices exceed the capacity
even of advanced economies. Eurostat economies, for example,
collect prices only in urban areas and use other sources to adjust
these to the national level. In the case of China, it was agreed
that China would collect prices for 11 municipalities, including
their surrounding rural areas, and that the World Bank and
the Asian Development Bank (ADB) would extrapolate these
to national average prices. The method adopted by the World
Bank and ADB matched urban and rural areas of the 11 municipalities
to the 31 provinces of China. However, the rural
areas included in the surveys may not have been representative
of those in the rest of China. See appendix E, which provides a
more detailed explanation.<br><br>
The overrepresentation of urban areas was not unique to
China. Brazil, for example, collected prices in only 6 cities.
Other economies in the South America region conducted price
collection in urban areas only. Because PPPs are based on a multilateral
comparison within each region, biases in data collection
should largely cancel out if all economies within a region
are similarly treated. In the Asia-Pacific region, the extent of
urban bias in China’s PPP measurements will depend on how
different were its data collection procedures―and the resulting
computation of national average prices―compared with those
of other economies in its region. India, for example, collected
both urban and rural prices for food, clothing, footwear, and
education. Prices for all other components of the GDP were
collected in 31 urban centers. However, because most goods
other than food are produced and purchased in the cities, the
urban prices of those goods can be considered representative
of the national prices. Further sensitivity analysis of the results
will be needed to quantify the extent of this bias, if any.<br><br>

Overview<br><br>
The 2005 International Comparison Program has produced
estimates of the relative price levels of GDP and its principal
aggregates for 146 economies. These purchasing power
parities express the values of local currencies in relation to
a common currency. In this report, the common currency
is the U.S. dollar in 2005. When applied to the value of
GDP or any component of GDP, the resulting values reflect
the real value of consumption in each economy, corrected
for differences in price levels and unaffected by transitory
movements of exchange rates. This report provides PPPs
and related measures for GDP, actual individual consumption
by households, collective consumption of governments,
and gross fixed capital formation. Additional tables provide
the same data for several important components of the
GDP (such as food, clothing, and housing, to name a few).<br><br>
The 146 economies account for more than 95 percent of
the world’s population and 98 percent of the world’s nominal
GDP. Table 8 lists the economies not included in the
2005 benchmark surveys along with estimates of their PPPbased
GDP per capita (computed as described in the section
“Estimation of PPPs for nonbenchmark economies”).<br><br>
This was the most extensive and thorough effort ever to
measure PPPs across economies. Teams in each region identified
characteristic goods and services to be priced. Surveys
conducted by each economy during 2005 and 2006 provided
prices for more than 1,000 goods and services. New
and innovative data validation tools were implemented to
improve data quality. Initial calculations of PPPs were conducted
at the regional level. In addition, a representative
group of economies, selected from each region, priced a
common set of goods and services. PPPs were calculated
separately for this “ring” and used to calibrate the regional
PPPs to the global level. It is these global PPPs that are now
reported here. Like the regional results, they have been
benchmarked to 2005, regardless of the year in which data
collection took place.<br><br>
The new benchmark results replace the PPPs and related
measures derived from previous surveys conducted during
1993C96 (for most developing economies) and 2000
and 2002 (for the CIS and the Eurostat-OECD). Data
for the economies in the 1993C96 benchmark had been
extrapolated forward and backward, using domestic price
indexes. Because such extrapolations happen at an aggregate
level, they cannot capture changes in relative prices at
the detailed level of the original surveys. Furthermore, the
2005 ICP covered a much broader set of goods and services
and, in most economies, collected more prices for them.<br><br>
(Appendix G provides more detail about the changes in
scope, coverage, and methodology that affected the comparison
of the previously estimated PPPs with those coming
from the 2005 benchmark surveys. The appendix also
includes a table showing the comparison by economy.)<br><br>

Compared with previous estimates, the size of developing
economies has decreased by 7 percentage points. The
global GDP shares of the largest developing economies are
also smaller. China, which was previously estimated to have
14 percent of global GDP, now has 10. And the estimate
of India’s share has been revised from 6 to 4 percent. But
it must be emphasized that these are changes in estimates,
the previous ones having been based on very old and very
limited data. The real outputs of their economies have not
changed, only the way we measure them has. This illustrates
why it is important to have new benchmark surveys because
the extrapolation procedures do not capture the structural
changes taking place within economies over time.<br><br>

<a href= "pic20.html">2005, Table 1 World shares of GDP</a><br><br>	
Figure 1 shows the distribution of World GDP to low-
, middle-, and high-income economies when using PPPs
and average exchange rates. Note that the world share of
the GDP for middle-income economies increases from
19 to 32 percent of the world economy when using PPPs
instead of exchange rates to calibrate the data to a common
currency. The 2005 ICP results show that developing
economies (low- and middle-income economies1 ) make
up a significant share of the world economy:2 around 39
percent. However, disparities remain striking. Low-income
economies, which include 35 percent of the world’s population,
produce 7 percent of global GDP. Middle-income
economies, with 48 percent of world’s population, produce
32 percent of global GDP. The GDP of high-income
economies accounts for 61 percent of the world economy,
received by only 17 percent of the world’s population.<br><br>

<a href= "pic20.html">2005, Table 1 World shares of GDP</a><br><br>

Table 1 shows the share of the world GDP by the largest
countries. Note that when measured using PPPs, 2005
world GDP is 55 trillion dollars, or 24 percent larger than
GDP converted to U.S. dollars using market exchange
rates. The reason is that exchange rates tend to understate
the purchasing power of the currencies of less developed
economies. This effect is particularly noticeable for lowand
lower-middle-income economies. For example, India’s
share of global GDP in 2005 is slightly greater than 4.3
percent when measured using PPP-based GDP, but only
1.8 percent when measured using market exchange rates.<br><br>
Using the new PPP estimates of GDP, the United
States remains the largest economy in the world, with a
world share of 22.5 percent, followed by China with 9.7
and Japan with 7.0. Of the 12 largest economies, which
together account for two-thirds of global GDP, 5 are lowor
middle-income economies: Brazil, China, India, Mexico,
and Russia, which collectively account for almost 22 percent
of global GDP.<br><br>
In each region,3 some major players emerge. Africa’s
economy is dominated by the Arab Republic of Egypt,
Morocco, Nigeria, South Africa, and Sudan, which collectively
account for two-thirds of the region’s GDP.4 Brazil
accounts for one-half of the South America economy. Russia
dominates the Commonwealth of Independent States
(CIS) with three-fourths of the total GDP. In the Asia-
Pacific region, China and India take the largest share, with
almost two-thirds of regional GDP. In Western Asia, Egypt5
and Saudi Arabia account for more than three-fifths of the
regional GDP.<br><br>

Table 2 shows that the economies with the highest GDP
per capita are Luxembourg, Qatar, Norway, Brunei Darussalam,
and Kuwait, all very small and accounting for less
than 1 percent of the world economy in total. The economies
with the lowest GDP per capita, all in Africa, are the
Democratic Republic of Congo, Liberia, Guinea-Bissau,
Niger, and Ethiopia.<br><br>
Because of margins of error inherent to any similar statistical
exercise, particularly in poor economies with low
statistical capacity, little significance should be attached
to small differences in estimated values. Nevertheless, the overall distribution of economies’ PPP-based GDP per capita
provides a reliable picture of the distribution of average
income between economies. PPP estimates show substantial
income inequalities among economies, although the degree
of inequality is less than if GDP per capita were measured
using market exchange rates. In 2005, the PPP-based GDP per capita of 17 economies was less than $1,000 (or less
than 11 percent of the world average). In the richest 39
economies, GDP per capita exceeded $20,000, which was
more than double the world average of $8,900.<br><br>
Figure 2 shows the distribution of the global GDP by
economy. The economies are arranged in the order of GDP
per capita along the horizontal axis and presented as rectangles.<br><br>
The rectangle’s length along the horizontal scale corresponds
to each economy’s share of the world population.<br><br>
Correspondingly, the GDP per capita as a percentage of the
world average is shown on the vertical axis. The economy’s
GDP size would be then represented by the rectangle area
for each economy, which is the product of population and
GDP per capita and thus would be directly comparable
among economies. As the economies are shown in increasing
order of real GDP per capita, the United States with the
sixth largest GDP per capita is placed at the right, with the
remaining countries reflected by the dark line because of
their small population. The intersection of the 100 percent
line with the rectangles shows that about three-fourths of
the world population is in economies with per capita GDP
below the world average.<br><br>
Even though China’s and India’s per capita consumptions
are both less than half of the world average, their
economies rank number two and five, respectively, which
shows the effect of their large populations accounting for
about 40 percent of the world total.<br><br>
Figure 3 shows per capita measures by region for
GDP, actual individual consumption, collective consumption
expenditure by government, and gross fixed capital
formation.<br><br>
Per capita measures of PPP-based GDP are useful for
comparing average living standards in different economies.
The Eurostat-OECD region has the highest GDP per
capita, by a wide margin. The CIS is next, ahead of South
America and Western Asia.
