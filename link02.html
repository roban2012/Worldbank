《经济学人》裙带资本主义指数排行榜：香港第一 中国落后于美国<br><br>

美国19世纪末20世纪初的“镀金时代”被视为垄断资本主义的高峰，像洛克菲勒这样的财阀掌握了国家大部分的财富，并通过贿赂政客为自己谋利。随之而来的大萧条一度让西方国家对此警醒，建立起更公平的经济体系。但英国《经济学人》杂志近期指出，如今发达国家正迎来第二次“裙带资本主义”时代，而新兴国家也在经历着历史上的第一次财富大集中。《经济学人》今年3月发布的“全球裙带资本主义指数”显示，香港已成为全球裙带资本主义最严重的地方，财富集中度接近80%。一向标榜自由经济的英国、美国也分别排名世界第15、17位，中国则排名世界第19，远远好于人们的印象。俄罗斯（2）、新加坡（5）、台湾（8）、印度（10）等新兴经济体均排在高位。<br><br>
<a href= "pic04.html">裙带资本主义全球排名</a><br><br>

英国著名经济期刊《经济学人》今年3月报道称，在最近20年的全球化中，1%的富豪阶层正在不正当地获取巨大的经济利益，把世界变成了一个新的“玛蒙之国”（Mammon是基督教传说中的恶魔，代表金钱和财富）。<br><br>
<a href= "pic04.html">裙带资本主义全球排名</a><br><br>

报道称，这些富豪正热衷于通过“寻租”来攫取利益，他们致力于分得蛋糕上更大的部分，而不是把蛋糕做得更大。赌场、能源、国防等领域成为富豪“寻租”的重灾区。<br><br>

《经济学人》制作了一张“全球裙带资本主义指数”排行榜。该指数参考了《福布斯》的全球富豪排名，来计算从事寻租重灾区行业的富豪的个人财产，以及他们的财产占国家（地区）GDP的比例。<br><br>

《经济学人》公布了全球23个主要国家和地区的排名情况，包括5个发达国家和10个较大的发展中国家（地区），以及另外8个经济规模较小但通常被认为取代严重的国家（地区）。<br><br>


数据显示，发展中国家裙带资本主义的严重性大约为发达国家的两倍，其裙带富豪财富占GDP的比重为4%，发达国家则为2%。<br><br>

香港的裙带资本主义指数远远高于其他国家和地区，富豪财富占GDP的比重接近80%，排名第二的则是俄罗斯，大约为20%。<br><br>
<a href= "link08.html">在不平等世界要包容</a><br><br>

近来动荡不安的乌克兰排在第4位，它与俄罗斯的情况都反映出前共产主义国家的转型所带来的恶果。<br><br>
美国在23个国家中排名第17位，这一排名已经比2007年的第12位有了明显的下降。不少美国民众和自由主义者认为他们的政府正在更多地照顾华尔街的利益，从而导致了2008年的严重金融危机。他们要求政府对华尔街巨头进行更多的限制。<br><br>

不过数据显示，美国的“裙带资本主义”并不主要存在于银行业，而是集中于硅谷这样的新技术行业。相比于甲骨文的拉里・埃里森（Larry Ellison）， 黑石集团的史蒂夫・施瓦茨曼（Stephen Schwarzman）只是个小虾米。<br><br>
<a href= "link10.html">格林斯潘：中国经济高增长是借来的</a><br><br>

《经济学人》称，中国在这一统计中表现良好，这让人十分意外。其原因一是国家控制了大部分的银行和自然资源，使得这些寻租的重要来源不会落入个人之手；此外，中国新兴产业的开放性培育出了一批健康的企业主，包括马云、梁稳根等。<br><br>

报道称，世界经济论坛指出，在这份榜单上表现良好的国家都拥有更好地官僚制度和机构，而香港政府的反垄断已经长期软弱无力。<br><br>

crony: 密友，亲密的伙伴 <br><br>


The countries where politically connected businessmen are most likely to prosper<br><br>

Mar 15th 2014 <br><br>


AMERICA’S Gilded Age, in the late 19th century, saw tycoons such as John D. Rockefeller industrialise the country―and accumulate vast fortunes, build palatial mansions and bribe politicians. Then came the backlash. Between 1900 and 1945 America began to regulate big business and build a social safety net. In her book “Plutocrats”, Chrystia Freeland argues that emerging markets are now experiencing their first gilded age, and rich countries their second, with the world’s wealthiest 1%, who benefited disproportionately from 20 years of globalisation, forming a “new virtual nation of Mammon”.
<br><br>
Inventing a better widget, tastier snack or snazzier computer program is one thing. But many of today’s tycoons are accused of making fortunes by “rent-seeking”: grabbing a bigger slice of the pie rather than making the pie bigger. In technical terms, an economic rent is the difference between what people are paid and what they would have to be paid for their labour, capital, land (or any other inputs into production) to remain in their current use. In a world of perfect competition, rent would not exist. Common examples of rent-seeking (which may or may not be illegal) include forming cartels and lobbying for rules that benefit a firm at the expense of competitors and customers.
<br><br>

Class warriors and free-market devotees alike are worrying about rent-seeking. American libertarians fear an elite has rigged their country’s economy; plenty of ordinary Joes reckon the government and Federal Reserve care more about Wall Street than Main Street. Many hedge-fund managers sniff that China is a house of cards built by indebted cronies.
<br><br>
To test the claim that rent-seekers are on the rampage, we have created a crony-capitalist index. Our approach builds on work by Ruchir Sharma of Morgan Stanley Investment Management, Aditi Gandhi and Michael Walton of New Delhi’s Centre for Policy Research, and others. We use data from Forbes to calculate the total wealth of those of the world’s billionaires who are active mainly in rent-heavy industries, and compare that total to world GDP to get a sense of its scale. We show results for 23 countries―the five largest developed ones, the ten largest developing ones for which reliable data are available, and a selection of eight smaller ones where cronyism is thought to be a big problem. The higher the ratio, the more likely the economy suffers from a severe case of crony-capitalism.
<br><br>

We have included industries that are vulnerable to monopoly, or that involve licensing or heavy state involvement (see table 1). These are more prone to graft, according to the bribery rankings produced by Transparency International, an anti-corruption watchdog. Some are obvious. Banks benefit from an implicit state guarantee that lowers their cost of borrowing. When publicly owned coal mines, land and telecoms spectrum are handed to tycoons on favourable terms, the public suffers. But the boundary between legality and graft is complex. A billionaire in a rent-heavy industry need not be corrupt or have broken the law. Industries that are close to the state are still essential, and can be healthy and transparent.

A galaxy of riches
<br><br>
Billionaires in crony sectors have had a great century so far (see chart 2). In the emerging world their wealth doubled relative to the size of the economy, and is equivalent to over 4% of GDP, compared with 2% in 2000. Developing countries contribute 42% of world output, but 65% of crony wealth. Urbanisation and a long economic boom have boosted land and property values. A China-driven commodity boom enriched natural-resource owners from Brazil to Indonesia. Some privatisations took place on dubious terms.
<br><br>
Of the world’s big economies, Russia scores worst (see chart 3). The transition from communism saw political insiders grab natural resources in the 1990s, and its oligarchs became richer still as commodity prices soared. Unstable Ukraine looks similar. Mexico scores badly mainly because of Carlos Slim, who controls its biggest firms in both fixed-line and mobile telephony. French and German billionaires, by contrast, rely rather little on the state, making their money largely from retail and luxury brands.
<br><br>
America scores well, too. The total wealth of its billionaires is high relative to GDP, but was mostly created in open sectors. Silicon Valley’s wizards are far richer than America’s energy billionaires. It is one of the few countries where rent-seeking fortunes grew only in line with the economy in recent years, which explains its improved position since 2007. Despite concerns about vampire-squid financiers, few of its billionaires made their money in banking. Even including private equity as rent-seeking, on the grounds that it benefits from tax breaks and cheap loans, would make little difference. Compared with Larry Ellison of Oracle, Stephen Schwarzman of Blackstone is a pauper.
<br><br>
Countries that do well on the crony index generally have better bureaucracies and institutions, as judged by the World Economic Forum. But efficient government is no guarantee of a good score: Hong Kong and Singapore are packed with billionaires in crony industries. This reflects scarce land, which boosts property values, and their role as entrepots for shiftier neighbours. Hong Kong has also long been lax on antitrust: it only passed an economy-wide competition law two years ago.
<br><br>
Another surprise is that despite its reputation for graft, mainland China scores quite well. One reason is that the state owns most natural resources and banks; these are a big source of crony wealth in other emerging economies. Another is that China’s open industries have fostered a new generation of fabulously rich entrepreneurs, including Jack Ma of Alibaba, an e-commerce firm, and Liang Wengen of Sany, which makes diggers and cranes.
<br><br>
One of the most improved countries is India, which moved from sixth place in our ranking to ninth. Recent graft scandals and a slowing economy have hurt many of its financially leveraged and politically connected businessmen, while those active in technology, pharmaceuticals and consumer goods have prospered. Turkish billionaires in rent-seeking industries have been hit by their country’s financial turmoil. By contrast most countries in South-East Asia, including Indonesia, Thailand and the Philippines, saw their scores get worse between 2007 and 2014, as tycoons active in real estate and natural resources got richer.

Who are you calling a crony（任用亲信 ）?
<br><br>
Our crony index has three big shortcomings. One is that not all cronies make their wealth public. This may be a particular problem in China, where recent exposés suggest that many powerful politicians have disguised their fortunes by persuading friends and family to hold wealth on their behalf. Unreliable property records also help to disguise who owns what.
<br><br>
Second, our categorisation of sectors is crude. Rent-seeking may take place in those we have labelled open, and some countries have competitive markets we label crony. Some think America’s big internet firms are de-facto monopolies that abuse their positions. South Korea’s chaebol, which sell cars and electronics to the world, are mainly in industries we classify as open. But they have a history of bribing politicians at home. China’s billionaires, in whatever industry, are often chummy with politicians and get subsidised credit from state banks. According to Rupert Hoogewerf of the Hurun Report, a research firm, a third are members of the Communist Party. Sectors that are cronyish in developing countries may be competitive in rich ones: building skyscrapers in Mumbai is hard without paying bribes, and easy in Berlin. Our index does not differentiate.
<br><br>
The third limitation is that we only count the wealth of billionaires. Plenty of rent-seeking may enrich the very wealthy who fall short of that cut-off. America’s subprime boom saw hordes of bankers earn cumulative bonuses in the millions of dollars, not billions. Crooked Chinese officials may have Range Rovers and secret boltholes in Singapore―but not enough wealth to join a list of billionaires. So our index is only a rough guide to the concentration of wealth in opaque industries compared with more competitive ones.
<br><br>
Despite the boom in crony wealth, there are grounds for optimism. Some countries are tightening antitrust rules. Mexico has many lucrative near-monopolies, from telecoms to food, but its government is at last aiming to improve regulation and boost competition. India’s legal system is trying to jail a minister accused of handing telecoms licences to his chums.
<br><br>

Encouragingly, there are also hints that cronyism may have peaked. The share of billionaire wealth from rent-seeking industries has declined in developing countries, from a high of 76% in 2008 to 58% (see chart 4). That partly reflects lower commodity prices. But now that emerging markets are slowing, investors are becoming pickier. More are steering clear of firms in opaque industries with bad governance. The price-earnings ratio of firms in crony sectors is now at its biggest discount to firms in open sectors for 15 years. That suggests that the highest returns to outside investors are to be found in open industries.
<br><br>
Perhaps when growth picks up again in emerging markets, rent-seeking will explode once more. Or, as countries get richer, the share of great wealth that is made in crony industries may naturally decline. In 1900 American tycoons became rich by building and financing railroads. By 1930 the action had shifted to food production, photography and retailing. Cronies around the world should take note.<br><br>

The new age of crony capitalism<br><br>
Political connections have made many people hugely rich in recent years. But crony capitalism may be waning<br><br>
Mar 15th 2014
<br><br>
AS THE regime of Viktor Yanukovych collapsed in Ukraine, protesters against it could be found outside One Hyde Park, a luxury development in west London. Their target was Rinat Akhmetov, Ukraine’s richest man and a backer of the old regime. “Discipline your pet”, they chanted.<br><br>

Ukraine’s troubled state has long been dominated by its oligarchs. But across the emerging world the relationship between politics and business has become fraught. India’s election in April and May will in part be a plebiscite on a decade of crony capitalism. Turkey’s prime minister is engulfed by scandals involving construction firms―millions of Turks have clicked on YouTube recordings that purport to incriminate him. On March 5th China’s president, Xi Jinping, vowed to act “without mercy” against corruption in an effort to placate public anger. Last year 182,000 officials were punished for disciplinary violations, an increase of 40,000 over 2011.
<br><br>



As in America at the turn of the 20th century, a new middle class is flexing its muscles, this time on a global scale. People want politicians who don’t line their pockets, and tycoons who compete without favours. A revolution to save capitalism from the capitalists is under way.<br><br>

The kind of rents estate agents can only dream of “Rent-seeking” is what economists call a special type of money-making: the sort made possible by political connections. This can range from outright graft to a lack of competition, poor regulation and the transfer of public assets to firms at bargain prices. Well-placed people have made their fortunes this way ever since rulers had enough power to issue profitable licences, permits and contracts to their cronies. In America, this system reached its apogee in the late 19th century, and a long and partially successful struggle against robber barons ensued. Antitrust rules broke monopolies such as John D. Rockefeller’s Standard Oil. The flow of bribes to senators shrank.<br><br>

In the emerging world, the past quarter-century has been great for rent-seekers. Soaring property prices have enriched developers who rely on approvals for projects. The commodities boom has inflated the value of oilfields and mines, which are invariably intertwined with the state. Some privatisations have let tycoons milk monopolies or get assets cheaply. The links between politics and wealth are plainly visible in China, where a third of billionaires are party members.
<br><br>
Capitalism based on rent-seeking is not just unfair, but also bad for long-term growth. As our briefing on India explains (see article), resources are misallocated: crummy roads are often the work of crony firms. Competition is repressed: Mexicans pay too much for their phones. Dynamic new firms are stifled by better-connected incumbents. And if linked to the financing of politics, rent-heavy capitalism sets a tone at the top that can let petty graft flourish. When ministers are on the take, why shouldn’t underpaid junior officials be?<br><br>

The Economist has built an index to gauge the extent of crony capitalism across countries and over time (see article). It identifies sectors which are particularly dependent on government―such as mining, oil and gas, banking and casinos―and tracks the wealth of billionaires (based on a ranking by Forbes) in those sectors relative to the size of the economy. It does not purport to establish that particular countries are particularly corrupt, but shows the scale of fortunes being created in economic sectors that are most susceptible to cronyism.<br><br>

Rich countries score comparatively well, but that is no reason for complacency. The bailing out of banks has involved the transfer of a great deal of wealth to financiers; lobbyists have too much influence, especially in America (see article); today’s internet entrepreneurs could yet become tomorrow’s monopolists. The larger problem, though, lies in the emerging world, where billionaires’ wealth in rent-heavy sectors relative to GDP is more than twice as high as in the rich world. Ukraine and Russia score particularly badly―many privatisations favoured insiders. Asia’s boom has enriched tycoons in rent-seeking sectors.<br><br>

<a href= "link10.html">格林斯潘：中国经济高增长是借来的</a><br><br>

Wanted: emerging-market Roosevelts<br><br>

Yet this may be a high-water mark for rent-seekers, for three reasons. First, rules are ignored less freely than they used to be. Governments seeking to make their countries rich and keep people happy know they need to make markets work better and bolster the institutions that regulate them. Brazil, Hong Kong and India have beefed up their antitrust regulators. Mexico’s president, Enrique Pena Nieto, wants to break its telecoms and media cartels. China is keen to tackle its state-owned fiefs.<br><br>

Second, the financial incentives for businesses may be changing. The share of billionaire wealth from rent-rich industries in emerging markets is now falling, from a peak of 76% in 2008 to 58% today. This is partly a natural progression. As economies get richer, infrastructure and commodities become less dominant. Between 1900 and 1930 new fortunes in America were built not in railways and oil but in retailing and cars. In China today the big money is made from the internet, not building heavy industrial plants with subsidised loans on land secured through party connections. But this also reflects the wariness of investors: in India, after a decade of epic corruption, industrialists in open and innovative sectors such as technology and pharmaceuticals are back in the ascendant.<br><br>

The last reason for optimism is that the incentives for politicians have changed, too. Growth has slowed sharply, making reforms that open the economy vital. Countries with governments that are reforming and trying to tackle vested interests, such as Mexico, have been better insulated from the jitters in the financial markets.
<br><br>
There is much more to be done. Governments need to be more assiduous in regulating monopolies, in promoting competition, in ensuring that public tenders and asset sales are transparent and in prosecuting bribe-takers. The boom that created a new class of tycoon has also created its nemesis, a new, educated, urban, taxpaying middle class that is pushing for change. That is something autocrats and elected leaders ignore at their peril.

一个真相：解密瑞士银行凤凰财经 <br><br>

2014-05-08<br><br>
据英国《金融时报》7日报道，世界最大的离岸金融中心瑞士承诺，将自动向其他国家交出外国人账户的详细资料。这对各国政府而言是巨大的进步，在全球金融危机和一连串税务丑闻后，它们发起了一场联合打击逃税的行动。如果要“撬开”纳税人的隐秘账户，瑞士的配合至关重要。<br><br>

数百年来，瑞士银行因严格的银行保密制度而闻名于世。至今瑞士银行的存款已占全球总储蓄额的1/3，瑞士银行管理着2.2万亿美元的离岸资产。与此同时，有不少人利用这一法律钻空子，或偷税漏税，甚至转移藏匿不法资产。<br><br>

瑞士――欧洲的世外桃源<br><br>

二战期间，由于瑞士特殊的中立国地位，瑞士成为纳粹德国和其他国家进行黄金交易的主要地点，各国纷纷向瑞士央行买卖黄金，以换取硬通货瑞士法郎。<br><br>

据称，当时纳粹德国的帝国银行90%的黄金交易就是通过瑞士央行进行的。<br><br>

16世纪，随着基督教加尔文教派的兴起，大量受迫害的新教徒从法国和意大利逃到瑞士日内瓦，这些新教徒也带来了大量金钱，交给日内瓦银行家打理。 <br><br>

1933年，德国政府要求德国公民必须交代自己在外国的资产。<br><br>

在瑞士，负责追查德国公民在外财产的纳粹盖世太保假装成普通客户，径直走入银行，拿出一沓钱，对银行职员说，将这笔钱存入某某的账户(这些都是遭到纳粹怀疑的人)。如果钱能够存入，则说明了该人在瑞士银行拥有账号。然而，那些使用匿名账户的客人，就安全逃过此劫。一年之内，有三个德国人因在瑞士拥有银行账号而被处死。三条人命给了瑞士充分的理由来加强银行保密法。<br><br>

1934年，瑞士当局颁布了《联邦银行法》，该法第47条明确规定：1.任何银行职员，包括雇员、代理人、清算人、银行委员会成员、监督员、法定审计机构人员，都必须严格遵守保密原则，保守其与客户往来情况及客户财产状况等有关机密。上述人员，包括引诱银行职员泄露客户和银行信息的第三人，都将面临最低6个月到5年的监禁，以及最高5万法郎的罚款。2.如是因为疏忽而泄露客户和银行信息，将酌情处罚，罚金不超过3万法郎。3.保密协议终身生效。不因为银行职员离职、退休、解雇而失效。<br><br>

因此，瑞士成了欧洲的世外桃源，欧洲的富人们都愿意把金银财宝放在这个地方。<br><br>
<a href= "link08.html">在不平等世界要包容</a><br><br>
<a href= "link06.html">三星：贪欲帝国</a><br><br>

恪守保密传统备受全球信赖<br><br>

瑞士各银行为加强保密，普遍采用了密码账户、化名代号等管理方式，即储户只在第一次存款时写真实姓名，之后便把户头编上代码。为了替储户严格保密，在苏黎世和日内瓦有116家专门办理秘密存储业务的银行――这还不算各大银行内设的私人储存窗口。在这些银行里，不准拍照，不讲姓名，有些甚至不设招牌，只标有经营者的名字。而且，办理个人秘密户头的职员要绝对可靠，大都是子承父业，世代相传，经过学徒制度的良好职业教育。<br><br>

长期以来瑞士恪守银行保密传统，赢得了全球客户的信赖，成为全球离岸金融中心，同时也是外国人的“避税天堂”。<br><br>
<a href= "pic04.html">裙带资本主义全球排名</a><br><br>
全球50％资金在“避税天堂”中转<br><br>

除了瑞士以外，“避税天堂”还有列支敦士登、奥地利、卢森堡、安道尔、摩纳哥、百慕大群岛、巴哈马群岛以及英属维尔京群岛等43个国家或地区，全球50％的资金经这些“避税天堂”中转。<br><br>

其中，维尔京群岛是目前全世界所有能自由进行公司注册的避税港中，要求最低，监管力度最小的。在那里，设立注册资本在5万美元以下的公司，最低注册费仅为300美元，加上牌照费、手续费，当地政府总共收取980美元，此后每年只要交600美元的营业执照续费即可。<br><br>

在与世界金融机构的合作过程中，摩纳哥、列支敦士登和安道尔被称为不合作避税地，原因是他们在情报交换方面进展缓慢。<br><br>

在“避税天堂”国家中，欧洲金融机构最爱选择英属泽西群岛，是因为这里的法律制度相对宽松。<br><br>

百慕大群岛被视为处理保险及再保险业务的最佳地区之一，是家族企业的最佳管理地点之一。<br><br>

中美洲的巴拿马目前拥有数百家银行和数千家注册公司，因为这里能迅速注册公司，免去了企业主对其行为不符合国际法规定的担心。
<br><br>
瑞士银行饱受争议遭各国围攻<br><br>

长期以来，瑞士银行的保密制度一直饱受争议。<br><br>

例如，瑞士银行曾吸纳了阿根廷前总统梅内姆和伊拉克前总统萨达姆等来路不明的钱，以及在“9・11”事件发生后，瑞士银行中发现多个恐怖嫌疑分子开设的账户。<br><br>

2000年，瑞士曾做过一个民意调查，1/3的人认为瑞士银行保密制度只为富人和奸商提供好处，10%的人希望彻底废除该制度。他们认为，偷税漏税已经不是简单的财政问题，而是一种严重的犯罪行为。<br><br>

美国和部分欧洲国家因瑞士等“避税天堂”国家吸纳本国避税客户对其积怨已久，只是难以找到对付的办法。2008年开始的金融危机让瑞士银行遮掩富人逃税之事更加公开化。美国和欧洲为保证税收收入，开始向瑞士施加压力。<br><br>

美国先以瑞银集团帮助美国富人逃税为由，把这个瑞士最大的银行告上法庭。瑞银不但交了巨额罚金，还破天荒地提供了250余名客户的名单。随后，法国、德国又威胁要把瑞士放到经合组织制定的“黑名单”里，以此要求瑞士提供更多的银行信息。<br><br>

各国仍然不依不饶，就在周二，法国巴黎举行的一次部长级会议中，瑞士同意签署新的《全球自动信息交换标准》，意味着瑞士结束了数百年来保护银行私人账户隐私的传统，同时也意味着瑞士2.2万亿美元私人账户将完全曝光。对全球范围来说，这将是爆发金融危机之后打击跨国公司逃税行为的关键一步。<br><br>

除去瑞士之外，另有44个国家签署了这一协议，其中包括其他经合组织(OECD)成员国，G20集团主要国家，还有开曼群岛等离岸金融中心。
<br><br>
在这一背景下，其他未签署协议的世界知名离岸金融中心将备受压力。G20集团已经着手对拒绝公开信息的国家采取制裁，OECD也将在今年晚些时候公布拒绝银行账户透明化国家的黑名单。<br><br>
